Kudos to the staff of the hotel - cannot thank them enough for the wonderful service. The hotel might have cost a lot but every dollar is worth the price. You get your money's worth when you decide to try and stay at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. The room is spacious and spotless. The furniture and necessities are modern. I can even praise the shower for having soft water bubbles. The breakfast buffet at the Rise was also enjoyable with lots of options that satisfy. The check in and check out process were seamless and pleasant. Thank you, Marina Bay Sands. My husband and I had the most amazing time.",

Even though we were not checked in at the hotel, the outside view was already so amazing and beautiful. The architecture is iconic, and the atmosphere around the area is vibrant, especially at night when the lights and the skyline come alive. It’s truly one of the must-see landmarks in Singapore, and we really enjoyed just walking around and taking photos.",

The views from the hotel are incredible, especially from the famous infinity pool, which we enjoyed so much and also the friendly service for drinks and food!\nThe property offers a variety of dining options, high-end shops, a casino, and a connected mall that has everything you need.\n\nBreakfast was excellent with a huge variety of choices, and I really enjoyed the afternoon tea as well. Our room was very spacious, very comfortable, and had everything we needed. The toiletries were high quality, and the room was kept very clean throughout our stay. The staff were very attentive at all times, concierge was so helpful. We felt welcome from start to finish.\n\nIt’s the kind of hotel where you can easily spend the whole day without leaving, but it’s also perfectly located for exploring the city. Overall, it was a wonderful stay!",

Check-in was smooth and efficient — we received a temporary room card that already gave us access to the pool, which was very convenient. We decided to do some shopping first, and when we returned to collect our official room cards, we were pleasantly surprised to learn that we had been given an upgrade. This gesture was truly appreciated.\n\nAs always, the pool and the food were excellent. You have the option to enjoy breakfast either by the pool or downstairs. If you're looking for a large buffet and don’t mind a lively atmosphere, the downstairs option is ideal. However, if you prefer a quieter, more refined experience with a set menu, the poolside breakfast is the better choice.\n\nWe thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would be happy to return again in the future.",

        "review_text": "While Marina Bay Sands dazzles visitors with its luxury shopping, world-class restaurants, and breathtaking architecture, my lasting memory comes from a group often overlooked: the housekeeping team.\n\nDuring what was otherwise a very difficult trip, these professionals became the highlight of my stay. The scale of their work is extraordinary—cleaning massive, high-tech rooms with meticulous precision, restocking coolers and amenities, and ensuring no detail is overlooked, all within tight time frames. As someone with severe OCD, I notice everything, and I was genuinely in awe.\n\nOne housekeeper, in particular, came to refill my ice bucket—something I didn’t even need—yet she bowed repeatedly and apologized as though she were inconveniencing me. Her humility and dedication were deeply touching. Later, another staff member surprised me with a vegan birthday cake, complete with a candle. I had forgotten it was even my birthday, but that thoughtful gesture nearly brought me to tears. It wasn’t just a dessert; it was a reminder that I was seen and valued.\n\nIn a hotel renowned for grandeur, it’s the quiet diligence of the housekeeping team that, in my view, forms the true backbone of Marina Bay Sands. They made me feel special, cared for, and genuinely welcome. I would return not just for the stunning rooms, but to personally thank and see these remarkable individuals again.\n\nThank you so much for this experience, it made my birthday trip.",

        "review_text": "1. The Landscape – Clean, Refined, and Aesthetically Pleasing\n\nWhat struck me most upon arriving in Singapore was how neatly orchestrated everything felt — as if every corner had been thoughtfully composed. The city is meticulously planned yet still breathes with nature. Green spaces are not just “added in,” they’re woven into the very fabric of the urban environment — from vast parks to rooftop gardens and tree-lined streets.\n\nEach district has its own flavor: Marina Bay is sleek and futuristic, Arab Street is a burst of color and culture, while Gardens by the Bay feels like stepping into a dream where technology and nature intertwine.\n\n2. Singapore at Night – Where the City Truly Shines\n\nIf Singapore in the daytime is a pristine canvas, then nighttime turns it into a masterpiece. As the sun sets, the city transforms — illuminated by thousands of lights that reflect off glass towers and gentle waterways.\n\nKey landmarks like Marina Bay Sands, Clarke Quay, Helix Bridge, and the lotus-shaped ArtScience Museum light up in ways that feel almost cinematic. Walking along the Singapore River at night, you can’t help but slow down — not from tiredness, but from awe. The “Spectra” light and water show at Marina Bay isn’t just a spectacle — it’s a moment that stays with you.\n\n3. The Rhythm of Life – Energetic, Yet Graceful\n\nDespite being a hub of finance, tech, and tourism, Singapore doesn’t feel overwhelming. People move quickly, but not anxiously. The city runs with purpose but still feels respectful, clean, and kind.\n\nThere’s a deep sense of order and mindfulness in how locals interact with public spaces — how they queue, how they keep the streets spotless, how they balance modern life with cultural roots. It's a quiet discipline that leaves a lasting impression.",

However, the service at the lobby and concierge is excellent.\n\nA few years ago, the hotel underwent a major renovation, and the rooms have been updated to a higher standard, which I’m really happy with. Since COVID, hotel prices in Singapore have risen across the board, and Marina Bay Sands is no exception. It’s now hard to find a room for under $700 a night.\n\nStill, the signature infinity pool is something you just can’t miss :) I often bring guests here, and the growing number of F&B outlets offers a variety of options, which is very satisfying.",

Of course, the infinity pool was the highlight for the whole family, but so were the light shows in the Garden and the Bay. The quick check-out was perfect since we had little time on the day of departure. Unfortunately, on the day of arrival, only one of the two booked rooms was ready, which is not ideal after a 14-hour flight when all you want to do is rest. But overall, the hotel is definitely worth the trip!",

From the moment I stepped into the lobby, I was blown away by the sheer elegance and attention to detail, the grand space, the warm lighting, and the stunning arrangements of pink lilies that filled the air with the most amazing fragrance. It set the tone for an unforgettable stay.\n\nThe service was beyond exceptional. Every staff member I met was warm, professional, and genuinely eager to make my experience perfect. The room was a sanctuary, spacious, spotless, and boasting breathtaking views of the Singapore skyline. The bed was so comfortable, it felt like sleeping on a cloud, and every amenity was thoughtfully provided.\n\nAnd then, the infinity pool… absolutely surreal! Swimming above the city, watching the sunset paint the skyline in gold and pink hues, was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. It felt like pure magic.\n\nThe location couldn’t be better, with easy access to everything Singapore has to offer. From start to finish, everything was flawless. This wasn’t just a stay; it was a memory I’ll cherish forever. Marina Bay Sands isn’t just a hotel, it’s an experience of a lifetime!!\n\nIf you’re considering it, don’t think twice. Absolute perfection! I can’t wait to return.",

The stunning view of the Gardens, especially when the Supertrees light up at night, added a magical touch. The bathroom was like a private spa, featuring a  luxurious Jo Malone amenities. The bed was incredibly comfortable, and the walk-in wardrobe was a nice luxurious bonus. Being right in the heart of the city during the F1 weekend made the stay even more exciting, watching the city come alive with the race vibes was unforgettable. The rooftop infinity pool was breathtaking — swimming there with the city skyline all around felt like something out of a dream. The rooftop bar was the perfect place to enjoy premium drinks while soaking up spectacular views. With impeccable service and exclusive access to The Club, the whole stay was a truly luxurious experience. Definitely one of the best and most memorable hotel stays I’ve ever had.",

It's a good 5-10 min walk away near the expo centre - while all the cardio equipment is new, the gym is TINY.

A buffet breakfast was included, but oh my goodness, it was extremely busy no matter what time we attended. One day, there were over 70 people in the queue waiting to be seated. We sent an email to the hotel, as one day, our allocated table was next to a door for anyone to go outside into the garden dining area. This particular breakfast wasn't enjoyable as it was a constant thoroughfare with so many other guests squeezing past. We received a phone call within a few minutes of sending our email. They understood our issue but didn't offer any solution. We weren't offered this table again 🙏 The said table was still in place the following day! We also sadly noticed the huge amount of food being wasted from a lot of guests.\nWe had a couple of issues having to wait, one was for some wine we had ordered for our room, we eventually after almost an hour of waiting received a call to advise the wine wasn't available!\nThe room itself was lovely & the views were beautiful. Overall the staff were extremely polite & very helpful.\nThe main thoroughfare near to reception is extremely busy, with anyone being able to access not just guests staying at the hotel as the shopping mall/cinema/casino/restaurants, etc, are accessible from here.\nWe do hope the infrastructure is being carefully considered whilst Tower 4 is being constructed, as the number of people moving through & around is extremely busy!!\nThe infinity pool was amazing though & enjoyable 😎",

Knowing the suite was a significant investment, we decided to maximize our time indulging in the luxurious amenities and breathtaking views from our room. While we did venture out, we primarily focused on enjoying the comfort and elegance of our suite, interspersed with a special dinner at the Paiza Sky Residence.\n\nThe suite itself was incredibly spacious and elegantly appointed, offering stunning panoramic views of the city skyline and Marina Bay. Kitty particularly loved the sheer size of the room, commenting on how much space there was to relax and unwind. The luxurious bedding and amenities were top-notch, but what truly impressed her was the luxurious bathroom. The enormous bathtub with a built-in jacuzzi was a standout feature, and the in-built bathroom TV added an extra touch of luxury.  She spent a considerable amount of time luxuriating in the tub, enjoying the jets and the in-bathroom entertainment.  We also made use of the in-room karaoke system (KTV), enjoying a fun and relaxing night of singing.\n\nOur dinner at the Paiza Sky Residence was, without a doubt, a highlight. The service was impeccable, the food exquisite, and the ambience sophisticated and elegant. The panoramic views from the Sky Residence were equally stunning, offering a different perspective on the city skyline compared to our suite.\n\nEven the little details were impressive. Kitty particularly enjoyed the high-quality toiletries provided. The  body lotion, hair shampoo, and conditioner all smelled divine. The complimentary drinks and fresh fruit in the room were a welcome touch. Everything was immaculately clean and seamlessly arranged, adding to the overall luxurious experience.\n\nWhile we did briefly explore The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands and the SkyPark Observation Deck having a short swin at the infinity pool, the majority of our stay was spent luxuriating in our suite and enjoying the exceptional dining experience at the Sky Residence. It was a splurge, but for a special occasion like Kitty's birthday, it was absolutely worth it.",

You guys don’t even take care of your workers- a relative of mine who has been working for your company as a cleaner for almost 8 years has just been told by his supervisor that because he’s “sick” which he isn’t, he was told he had no job when he turned up to work, and not even given a formal letter of termination. He was told that he would be contacted by HR on Monday which is astonishing. We’ve contacted your front desk and from what we’ve been told, HR is on it but we don’t know when we’ll be called. We have contacted MOM about this because the situation is beyond unfair- this is a man who’s elderly and who is getting his eye fixed. He’s not blind or sick. This smacks of unfair termination, and his supervisor should’ve gone through the right channels and or tried to help him. He knows that his only issue is his diabetes which doesn’t make him ill. Well, we hope that the Hr will get back as soon as possible. Either way, we have contacted MOM about this unfair treatment and we hope that this issue can be solved soon. Imagine doing this to an elderly person who has worked hard for your company for ages, is always early and makes sure he’s on time. This is awful.",

It’s only accessible to hotel guests, but if you get the chance to stay, it’s worth it for that view alone. There’s also a public observation deck if you're not staying at the hotel.\n\nInside, MBS features a high-end shopping mall with luxury brands, a canal with gondola rides, and a wide variety of restaurants—from celebrity chef fine dining to local delicacies. The ArtScience Museum and nightly Spectra light and water show at the promenade are great additions that make it a complete entertainment destination.\n\nIt’s directly connected to Gardens by the Bay via a beautiful pedestrian bridge, and the Bayfront MRT station is just below the complex, making it super accessible.\n\nWhether you're staying the night, coming for a show, or just enjoying the views, Marina Bay Sands offers a world-class experience in the heart of Singapore.",

The room was beautiful and has some of the most impressive latest technology and the service is truly quite amazing.  And of course  - the rooftop infinity pool is one of a kind in this world.\n\nWe were fortunate enough to stay at the room facing Gardens by the bay with a large walk-out balcony. While the room was quite small, it was jam-packed with all kinds of tech features that even blow the Japanese hotels away.\n\nThe  service was absolutely remarkable. Any need was fulfilled within 10 mins or less from the call, and the staff truly cared about ones comfort.\n\nThe breakfast had the \"quantity over quality\" feel to it. As to be expected,  the spread was quite massive, with quite massive crowds to boot. Best to go before 08:30am to avoid any lines.\n\nOf course, the rooftop infinity pool is a 10/10. Incredible in every way, a true modern marvel. We visited several times through several days and even at night and found plenty of loungers available. Staff was there to provide quick drink and snack service as well.\n\nOverall , I was left impressed with the MBS. The room was impeccably clean and showed zero signs of wear. Its quite impressive how such a large enterprise can keep the service level so high. And the service was amazing, but one does feel a bit like a number based on the size of the hotel. Would definitely stay here again.",

The Spectra light and water show at night by the bay is a highlight not to be missed—free and beautifully choreographed.\n\nWhile it is on the pricier side, the experience is unmatched and worth it at least once.

For MBS I felt more could be done towards the guests. For example the Rise restaurant where you have your breakfast and hight teas just seem basic. The food offered as part of the booking (buffet style) is more likely to be the left overs from A La Carte menu on the other side of the restaurant. I suppose it's food served that is not going to waste!",

The iconic property boasts breathtaking landscapes that immediately transport you to a world of luxury and elegance. While my visit was brief, I was able to immerse myself in the grandeur that Marina Bay Sands is renowned for.\n\nUpon arrival, I regretfully missed the opportunity to dine at their Italian restaurant due to its closing hours. Nevertheless, I was compensated by the exceptional service and warm hospitality extended by the staff, making me feel welcome and valued throughout my stay.\n\nOne highlight of my visit was the casino experience, even though I am not a gambling enthusiast. Watching my friend revel in the excitement of the baccarat table was a joy in itself. The refreshing lemonade cucumber tea served at the casino instantly became a favorite, earning the amusing moniker \"hot mountain dew\" from us.\n\nWhile exploring the expansive mall area, I marveled at the architecture and design surrounding me. The sheer scale of the mall was impressive, filled with an array of stores and amenities that cater to every need and desire. Although I missed the chance to fully indulge in retail therapy due to the late hour, the ambiance alone was enough to leave a lasting impression.\n\nDespite the closing time of most establishments in the mall, we found solace in dining at the exclusive club restaurant. The culinary experience was nothing short of exceptional, offering a delectable array of dishes that tantalized our taste buds and left us craving for more. The impeccable service and attention to detail truly elevated our dining experience to a new level of luxury.\n\nOne cannot help but appreciate the intricate beauty and craftsmanship that permeates every corner of Marina Bay Sands. From the lavish decor to the stunning views of the surrounding cityscape, every aspect of the property exudes sophistication and opulence. The meticulous attention to detail is evident in every aspect of the hotel, ensuring a seamless and unforgettable experience for every guest.\n\nThe unparalleled views from the observation deck left me in awe of the panoramic vistas that stretched as far as the eye could see. The expansive skyline of Singapore, coupled with the stunning waterfront views, created a mesmerizing backdrop that encapsulated the essence of urban beauty and modernity.\n\nThroughout my stay, I was consistently impressed by the level of service and professionalism displayed by the staff at Marina Bay Sands. Their dedication to ensuring the comfort and satisfaction of guests was commendable, making me feel valued and appreciated at every interaction.\n\nIn conclusion, Marina Bay Sands Singapore is a true gem that offers a luxurious and immersive experience like no other. From the exquisite landscapes to the world-class amenities and exceptional service, every aspect of the property is designed to exceed expectations and create lasting memories. My short but unforgettable stay at Marina Bay Sands has left me eager to return and indulge in all the wonders this iconic destination has to offer.",

The service was amazing and despite being such a big hotel, I did not feel lost or without attention. There is also a laser light show at the marina bay sands complex at night which was fun. Get there early to secure good seats. The area is fun to walk around or jog. There is also a mall attached and a casino. (Did not go so can’t comment)",

        "review_text": "A Sky-High Experience with Spectacular Views\n\nWe visited hotel’s observation deck. This observation deck offers a panoramic view of the city that is truly breathtaking.\n\nThe primary draw of the Marina Bay Sands Observation Deck is, of course, the view. From this vantage point, you get an unobstructed, 360-degree view of Singapore’s stunning skyline, the bustling Marina Bay, and the vast expanse of the sea stretching into the distance. On a clear day, you can see as far as Indonesian lands.\n\nThe view encompasses some of Singapore’s most iconic landmarks. You’ll see the lush greenery and futuristic structures of Gardens by the Bay, including the Supertree Grove and the two glass conservatories. The sight of the Marina Bay area from above, including the Merlion, the Esplanade, and the Singapore Flyer, is particularly striking. As the sun sets, the city transitions into a vibrant display of lights, making the evening visit a magical experience. The colors reflecting off the bay and the dazzling city lights make it an ideal spot for photographers.\n\nThe Observation Deck itself is expansive, offering plenty of room to move around and take in the views from different angles. Unlike other observation decks that might feel cramped, this one provides ample space for everyone to enjoy the view without feeling crowded, even during peak hours. The deck is designed to ensure safety while providing an open, airy feel.\n\nOne of the unique aspects of the deck is its open-air design. Unlike enclosed observation decks with glass barriers, the Marina Bay Sands deck offers an unobstructed view, allowing you to fully immerse yourself in the surroundings. The feeling of standing 57 floors above ground, with the wind in your hair and the city sprawled out beneath you, is exhilarating.\n\nTo get the most out of your visit, I recommend timing your trip to coincide with sunset. Arriving about an hour before sunset allows you to experience the transition from day to night. Watching the sun dip below the horizon, casting a warm golden hue over the city, is a moment of pure beauty. As day turns to night, the city’s lights begin to sparkle, creating a mesmerizing scene that’s perfect for capturing on camera.\n\nAnother highlight of an evening visit is the nightly Spectra Light and Water Show at Marina Bay Sands. From the Observation Deck, you get a unique, bird’s-eye view of this show, which combines dancing fountains, colorful lights, and music in a spectacular display. The view from above adds an extra dimension to the experience, allowing you to appreciate the choreography of the water jets and lights in their entirety.\n\nThe Observation Deck also offers a few additional amenities that enhance the experience. There’s a small bar where you can purchase drinks and snacks, allowing you to relax and enjoy the view with a refreshing beverage in hand.\n\nIt’s worth noting that the open-air design means it can get quite hot during the day, so bringing sunscreen and a hat is advisable if you’re visiting earlier in the day.",

The pool is also incredible! Staff is friendly there as well though reasonably strict about only allowing guests through (do NOT lose your room key!).

The executive room was fab and appeared like bigger than 3 bed flat.  City view from room and lounge area was amazing. Room was on 45th floor. Hi Tech touch panel everywhere to control lights, curtains and AC. Fully automatic smart toilet with touch panel, what a luxury !! Jacuzzi, 12 point shower panel, 2 wash basin in bathroom and a tv in front of bath. Separate dressing area, dining area, bar area, lounge area with 6 seater sofa having 75 inch TV. It was fab. Only thing I didnt like was the big queue for breakfast. This hotel is super expensive and seeing guests standing in a long queue was no pleasure at all. Then, though we were upgraded to executive room but were denied breakfast since it wasnt part of my original booking but executive suits cones with by default breakfast. Its like getting upgraded to business class from economy class but cabin crew serving you food of economy class which is rare or I have never heard of. Singapore is heaven for food and we wanted to explore local food hence it wasnt an issue at all but this is something MBS management shoul look into and consider my airlones analogy. Infinity pool, observation deck was easily accessible.",

Make sure you have reservations.\nService - it is a hit or miss- at times you feel pampered and cared for, at times ignored.\nGive yourself some time to eat from one place to another. The towers are quite massive and it takes some time to figure out and get from one point to the next.

The pool is amazing, I did not think I would be that amazed but I was speechless once in it. The pool has a booking system of an hour and 15 minutes. We felt that it was very well organized by the whole staff considering the pandemic. At least it wasn't crowded at all. :) We tried the gym, too.

It's got great services taken care of by the service teams, from filling up the bathroom amenities to booking a taxi for you, and immediately upon arrival - a warm (refreshing rather as it's pretty hot in Singapore already) welcome from the moment the taxi stops at the drop-off zone. The hotel has a great roof top pool with infinity edge, which is accessible to all guests through a transfer of lift. The hotel room felt luxurious - not my favourite style but every detail in the bathroom to the balcony was well considered. Highly recommended!",

        "review_text": "My trip to Marina Bay Sands was nothing short of spectacular, and I can't wait to share my experience with you. This iconic destination in Singapore is truly a marvel.\n\nFirst off, the architecture is jaw-dropping. The three towering buildings connected by that massive rooftop deck, which includes the famous infinity pool, are a testament to human engineering at its finest. As soon as I arrived, I was in awe of the sheer scale and design of this place.\n\nNow, let's talk about the shopping. The mall inside Marina Bay Sands is a shopper's paradise. You'll find all the high-end brands you can think of, and if you're a fan of luxury shopping, this is the place to be.\n\nBut the real star of the show is the view. From the rooftop deck, you get an unparalleled panoramic view of the Singapore skyline. I recommend going up there during sunset – the sight is simply breathtaking. And don't forget your camera because you'll want to capture every moment.\n\nNow, onto the services. They are top-notch, just as you'd expect from such a renowned destination. The staff is incredibly friendly and always ready to assist with a smile. I felt well taken care of during my entire visit.\n\nFor those planning a visit, here are some tips. Aim to visit in the evening to catch the mesmerizing light show. Check the weather forecast because Singapore can surprise you with sudden rain. And budget accordingly, as Marina Bay Sands offers a plethora of experiences, and you'll want to make the most of your time here.\n\nIn terms of improvements, it's hard to find fault, but perhaps more affordable dining options could make the experience even more accessible to a wider range of visitors.\n\nIn conclusion, Marina Bay Sands is a must-visit destination in Singapore. It combines stunning architecture, world-class shopping, and breathtaking views into an unforgettable experience. So, if you find yourself in Singapore, make sure to put this gem on your itinerary – you won't be disappointed!",

At sunset is very crowded and in my opinion it is even more impressive in the dark and there is not much going on. From the rooms I was unfortunately a little disappointed, you pay the high price only for the pool, the rest of the hotel is below the renowned 5 star competition.\nThe associated shopping center is also spectacular and one of the largest I have ever seen. Small travel hack in the in-house casino you get drinks, cigarettes and more for free.",

So many great food options and even kids areas to play at. Also the Arts and Science museum next to it is a fascinating experience.",

Everyone comes here for the rooftop infinity pool, which is breathtaking and a must if you visit Singapore, however I was equally impressed with the complete package. The complex itself is absolutely huge, from the shopping centre to casino to various different top quality restaurants. From the moment you arrive and go through the efficient, time-allotted check in, the staff are so friendly and attentive. The rooms are massive and emaculately clean, bed is comfy and bathroom/shower is great. Certainly not cheap but you really feel like you get what you pay for with the whole experience.",

The room key card is also required to access the infinity pool on the roof, which also allocates you a towel.\n\nThe pool is amazing. It is warm and has the most amazing views across the river to Singapore, including the Merlion. The food is amazing. You can sit around the pool with anything from squid sushi rolls to burger and fries (both of which are delicious).\n\nWhilst the pool is only open to hotel guests the observation deck is open to the public.\n\nThere is nothing to dislike about this experience. Well worth the stay. The last thing to mention is the staff, every one has been brilliant, friendly and charming.",

They do not mention this when ur booking the stay but they do inform u at the receptionist that in order to enter the infinity pool either to enjoy it or just walk around, you need to book a slot. Its an hr slot for each time ur book. And its limited. Due to they capped it at only 50-100pax at each slot. My advice is u book it when checking in. If u manage to get a slot, it will be fabulous.  The pool is basically empty due to everyone is spreaded apart. My kids had a good time since there were more space for them to play . ◡̈",

The rooms here are luxurious and spacious! With well known amenities such as the infinity pool! The gym is well equipped. Even the showering facilities isn’t the gym looks luxurious! The only down side would the location of the gym. It is located in another building/ tower, so guests have to walk quite a distance! The gym staffs were polite and courteous as well. They also serve complimentary TWG tea or coffee for gym users after the session ☕️🍵 all in all a very good place for staycation to take a break! MBs offers  a wide array of food options and amenities!",

Sky bridge in the middle of the Hotel. You can watch Garden by The Bay if u go the other side of the Bridge from the shopping entrance escalator. Look up and u will see the big ship on top of the Hotel. It is was an amazing place to be",

It's the surroundings. You have a huge shopping mall attached to the hotel that has everything you can need as well as the casino for those of you who like to take risks. And you can't not mention the infinity pool on the roof. Singapore is a warm country so just sitting up there on the roof. Looking out over the skyline relaxing in a pool is by far one of the best feelings in the world. The staff was amazing. Everybody was very nice and professional. There's absolutely zero complaints about this hotel.  Of course, because of the surroundings everything's a little pricey, but what do you expect.?? There's a club located in the mall called marquee which is amazing, one of the best clubs in the world I would say. And then on the roof next to the pool you have another club and a restaurant called celavi\nI spent almost a week here and I really had no reason to leave the hotel or the area.",

The hotel has no walk-in capacity for stay in guests at any bar/lounge, everything need to be booked in advance. We were planned to stay there for 3 nights but couldn’t find a place for a casual drink at any bar/lounge. The staff there was very friendly and managed to help us made a reservation at one of its bar, but there is a dress code which doesn’t allow any guests entry with slippers and shorts. (For god’s sake we just wanted to have a couple of drinks at the bar, who would wear a formal suit on the holiday with the temperature is around 33 degree Celsius)\n\nI gave 2 star only to the staff there, they are very well trained and friendly.

It took almost half an hour once I got to the front of the line and then I was told my room wasn’t ready and wouldn’t be for “maybe an hour” - this was at 3:30pm. You are paying a grand a night for that room, you would expect your room to be ready by the usual 3pm time. Luckily I asked if we could go up and use the pool until we had our room which they allowed and were nice about but they didn’t offer that up front. The staff are really nice but the hotel seems to have some strange and very strict processes which makes the stay feel really not holiday-yee. We loved the pool and staff but Otherwise the feel of the place wasn’t enjoyable. We hoped the experience for the price would be better!!\nMust say they were helpful with storing luggage though!",

Because our son just turned 12 few days before our check-in, we were told the room we booked was not sufficient for the 4 of us due to fire safety regulations. 12 years is considered adult. So we were offered a room that was 3 times more than the reservation we made. Which did not really fit into our budget. After waiting a little bit longer around the lobby, they found a solution that was more acceptable and finally - we checked in! The room was on the 46th floor - really nice view to the Harbor. The only cons I could find were - no toilet bidet and the pillows - way too big and uncomfortable. We did have an incident right next to our room- 3 am in the morning we were woken up by loud screams and crying on the hallway. Really scared us and the kids. But overall a nice experience that we wanted to try - the swimming pool and the breakfast were amazing!",

However, you should be prepared for the fact that it can also be quite tiring. The sheer size of the complex means there is a lot of ground to cover, and the lack of available seating areas can make it difficult to take a break and rest tired feet. Despite this, the experience of Marina Bay Sands is well worth it, as long you take it slow and are prepared to pace  and to take the time to fully appreciate everything this iconic location has to offer.",

We had a dedicated team- Erica & Mark- assisting us with an early check-in.

They are comfortable too.\nThe room service delivers in less than 30 min at 9 PM. It's tasty.\n\nThere is no alcohol in the mini bar, but everything is free and refills every day.\n\nThe WiFi is very easy to access but not available when you are in your balcony and the windows are closed. Very reliable and fast enough to do everything  you want.\n\nWhen you are on the balcony in a garden room, the road is a bit noisy. But when you close the windows, you can't hear quite nothing.\n\nBetween levels 10th to 20th in the garden side, you'll access twice per night to the gardens by the bay show directly from your room. Very pleasant.\n\nThere is a SMRT station in the mole next to the hotel.\n\nThere is a supermarket in this mole.\n\nWe went 3 or 4 times (morning, afternoon, evening) in the swimming pool and never had to wait: there were always plenty of free spaces.\n\nEasy checkout. (Less than 2 min).\n\nBad points:\n- WiFi not available on balcony\n- road noise on the garden side in the lower levels\n- 1st price wine in the room service which could be better.\n- would love not finding the lights turned on after every room service.",

I noticed 2 guys in suits carrying iPads but they would occasionally disappear.  Waiting for your turn to check in is a lengthy process. You can hardly read the number on the iPad showing which customer number is being serviced if you are a few feet away so people wander back and forth to check.  Not a very restful scene to see after a long day of travel. The iconic rooftop pool is a nice feature but gets super crowded and not enough recliners/sitting area.  Went to the pool at 0830 and it wasn’t busy yet. Hard to book on their restaurants. Our room was spacious with a great view of the Marina Bay Gardens. Nothing so special with the room, though.  It’s like a typical Vegas hotel room. I checked this experience off my bucket list. Will try staying at other hotels next time I visit.",

Apart from the shopping mall and hotel restaurants, I don't there are other cheap eats or supermarket nearby. The metro station is next to the hotel though. Also much quicker to get to the airport from here compared to the downtown hotels - it's closer to the highway.\n\nCheck in:\nThere are queues to check in and it took us about 20 minutes. Make sure you ask everything you need to to avoid queuing again! They were relaxed about extending check out by an hour to 12pm. We had a basic garden view king bed room. They gave a free mooncake which was a nice touch.\n\nRoom:\nVery clean and seemed modern (not sure if it has been refurbished recently). Large bathroom with good shower. Huge TV screen! Balcony was spacious with stunning views of Gardens by the Bay and the ships beyond.\n\nPool:\nWe missed sunset but went at about 7am. Few people around then so easy to have great photos just after sunrise. Possible to swim a few lengths too. There are 3 main pools and one of these allows children with supervision. There is also a very small children's pool with clear plastic walls. Definitely the highlight of our stay. The pool staff know this is why people stay at the hotel and they are very helpful and friendly. The pool is open from 6am to 11pm.\n\nHighly recommend a stay here as part of a Singapore vacation. It is the iconic building of Singapore - combine it with Gardens by the Bay. 2 nights may be better - we didn't have time for ArtScience museum, the Spectra light show, or wandering around the mall.",

Access to the pool is strictly by one room key being presented per adult.\n\nWhere this place really falls down is that you absolutely must place a reservation if you want to eat. We were turned away at every single restaurant on the night we arrived and ended up having to order room service food. Inevitably wth a place this size, even despite the insulated trolley, it was cold by the time it got to us. For those of us who are more spontaneous, this is frustrating.",

It is not only beautiful, but waking up on the 50+ floors you feel like a king. I would recommend staying 2 to 3 nights here then move on to a beach place like sentosa or vice versa. The hotel amenities obviously is the access to the pool which is until 10pm. The gym is 24/7 and staff is there until 11pm. Water pressure was not the best but big enough shower to feel comfortable.",

From the absolutely amazing laundry to the incredible breakfast and dinners, utterly stunning roof top pool to swim, rest, incredible views and lots of pics!!!!\n\nMBS works like clockwork. It’s immaculately clean throughout, the amazingly stunning displays in the atrium and hall created in house, check in a dream and so informative to the incredible caring staff who come over and talk to you.\n\n5 stars isn’t high enough.

(For us as westerns traveling with a toddler was  super difficult to find good western/international food close to the hotel) Definitely not for families . If you need a playground or a kids club for your kids they will tell you to visit the mall… incredible! However if you are in a party-all-night mood can be convenient as there are so many choices.

The event manager, Rachel Ho, was very attentive to all our needs and went above and beyond in making our wedding a pleasant and memorable event. Her experience helped us immensely during the planning as she guided us on timeline and decision-making. Everything was arranged promptly and perfectly for us, including special requests. She made our wedding planning a much less stressful process for us, which was a huge plus point which we appreciate deeply.\n\nThe dining banquet hall was big and spacious, and the decorations were beautiful as shown in pictures. Food was sumptuous and delightful.\n\nOur package included a night stay in the wedding suite. The room was big and had an excellent view of Gardens by the Bay and the sea, a stunning view to wake up to in the morning. It was luxurious and much needed relaxation, especially after the wedding night.\n\nPremium service team were ever-ready to assist us, anticipating our needs to provide us with an exceptional experience. Special shout out to Andre and Celeste who arranged for chocolates in our room and even gave us a thoughtful souvenir to let us remember our wedding and stay at MBS.\n\nOverall, we had an unforgettable experience and will not hesitate to recommend MBS Singapore to anyone who plans to hold a wedding in the future.\n\nThank you again!",

And while I am glad we did, I likely wouldn’t stay there again honestly.  For the price, the rooms were really pretty average.  The view we had overlooking the Gardens by the Bay was great though as you could watch the Garden light show from your (tiny) balcony.  Bathroom was nice and large with good amenities.  Staff was overall friendly. The crowds definitely didn’t make it feel personal.  And frankly staying here felt almost like work rather than relaxing.  You had to remember to request check-in times and schedule pool times a day in advance (hard to do while traveling). Then each person has to have their own QR code—only available by SMS—for the pool, which was a problem because some in our party didn’t have cellular service to get the code. Luckily the pool staff accepted the room key and my confirmation email (likely helped we went early before it was crowded).  The pool was definitely impressive!!  It was also frustrating because they advertise over 90 restaurants but we didn’t know they all required reservations, even for lunch.  Most of these were in the mall (full of all the fancy stores and nothing in our price range!). We had a lot of trouble finding places to walk into to eat and that was just annoying.  It was also very crowded.  We did not visit the casino. Honestly the best way to describe the hotel is that you’ll feel like you are in a busy Vegas hotel like Caesar’s or the Bellagio.  It felt more like that than a 5 star hotel, especially considering it was likely the most expensive basic room I’ve ever stayed in.\nAgain it was fun to say we stayed there. We don’t regret it. But probably wouldn’t do it again. Just go into knowing to expect waits and crowds and that you are doing it to see one of the coolest pools ever.\n\nI should note that one in my party completed a mid-stay survey from the hotel and got an almost instant follow up call. So they do seem to care about customer service.",

The main concourse feels like an airport terminal except there is nowhere to sit and relax, have a coffee, and catch up with work or watch the world go by. The restaurants are OK but not great and the mall is very expensive and exclusive. We did like the lounge bar though and the gardens are great.

I booked a room that was supposed to be 12th floor and above, but I got a room on the 10th saying I was upgraded. I loved the room, but did not enjoy the unknowingly genuine and/or needlessly patronizing comment. Again, not that 10th vs 12th floor mattered, and again I loved the room, but could have done without the above. During breakfast, folks ask for room number incessantly, almost giving the feeling the staff are not connected and/or communication, or that they are suspicious about me and think I am hanging around wanting a freebie. Breakfast selection is great, but there could be a better system in place to avoid asking for the room number a few times during breakfast. Perhaps tattooing it on the forehead would help? 😉",

(Their website for some reason only allows Brookings for 3 people per room).\n\nBeing told by check-in staff that we had no room, after an 8 hour flight was exacerbating... If they'd told us before making payment we'd have simply walked out.\n\nIt was quite a horrible ruse.\nIt is entirely unfair and unreasonable.\n\nSomehow after stating it was a ridiculous idea that four of us would share a bed, a room materialised.\n\nThe room was fine (just a standard room), however had two issues.\n\n1) It is NOT a garden Room view which we booked and paid.\n\n2) There are no linens for my second child. They missed out on even a towel.\n\nTo avoid frustration we decided to explore the hotel, where we looked for the observation deck.\n\nThe CE LA VE staff were simply rude.\n\nTold us they were fully booked before we even had a chance to ask what CE LA VE was... I'm still not sure, I think it's a restaurant which we're not welcome to attend.\n\nI travel around the world for work, and this is surely the most over-hyped hotel I have ever stayed.\n\nBeds are uncomfortable, service is slow.\n\nThe pool view is great, but hardly anything to dribble over for your Instagram.\n\nOh at 9:30pm we had staff try and deliver a birthday cake... Which would have been nice, but it wasn't anyone's birthday.\n\nSomeone did try and call to \"apologies\" but their solution was to give us free breakfast... Which I had to inform them we'd already paid for with our room.\n\nWith so many nice hotels in Singapore, why bother?",

From the time we check-in, the front desk check in process was seamless and attentive. They aware that it’s my birthday and arrange a birthday cake send to my room.\n\nThe highlight of the trip definitely is the infinity pool. We manage to book a swimming pool slots by their online systems and the pool capacity is limited due to the covid SMM. This creates a even more magical moment to me as all of us get to have a beautiful slots in pool to relax and take lots of lovely photos.\n\nPrior entering the pool, one of my biggest concern will be the water quality in the swimming pool as I had sensitive skin where I avoid public pool due to the cleanness and chlorine. To my surprise, I didn’t had any skin irritation after the swim! I’m truly amazed by the water quality of the swimming quality and the team that maintain the pool definitely deserve a praise!\n\nOverall we had a very pleasant stay especially the experience in the infinity pool. Will definitely go back for the stay again!",

Not to mention their infinity pool - which gets very busy but its and experience you must do.",

Also it failed to accept payment from my Citibank Visa card.\n\nSo I had to look around for ATM, at 11 pm, get some cash from it, with NO PROBLEM using that debit card that was rejected by the hotel, and head back again.\n\nAnd of course the check-out process became slower, because I had to get back my deposit as cash again.\n\nAnd during the whole stay in S'pore I was, ALWAYS, able to use that debit card with no problem - except in a small diner, where the staffs does not even  speak English & only accept NEST or cash; but that's of course  understandable. A five star hotel? Unbelievable.\n\n====\n\nThe hotel staffs however are amazing and very helpful. It's clear from their body language that they're genuinely care about you.\n\nOnce I had to ask for help with the TV, I tried to connect it to my laptop via HDMI cable, but no joy. The tech guy arrived shortly, and very apologetic.\nHe listened to my explanation, and fully accept that the issue is on their side - usually, people will try to blame my laptop (I use Linux, not Windows)\n\nHe worked really fast, but clearly it stumped him at first. He apologized so much I almost laughed - I had to say to him to take his time, I'm in no rush at all; yet he still tried his hardest. It was amazing.\n\nPretty soon he figured out the root cause, and my laptop finally able to connect to the TV. I thanked him, and he apologized again in return, while it was not even his fault.\n\nThe hotel should count itself very lucky to have such diligent staffs like him.\n\nI forgot to ask for his name, anyway I stayed in room 520, from 11 to 13 Dec 2022.",

Since that was true, my expectations were particularly high. And Marina Bay just didn’t meet them.\n\nDoing anything there is more challenging than most hotels. You have to reserve a time to check in. That’s actually more of a problem than it seems since most people fly in on international flights and have to clear customs and immigration, which can be unpredictable. Plus, reservation times become limited the closer to your stay. We arrived about an hour and a half earlier than our reservation. It was not immediately clear what to do when we arrived. Just about 30 seconds before we were approached by a helpful staff member, we noticed a small sign with a lot of writing and a QR code that signs you into the check in queue. We scanned the code, and after about a 10-minute wait, it was our turn to approach the desk and start the check in process. Evidently there are times of the day when Registration is extremely crowded, so the hotel has instituted these extra steps. Thankfully, it wasn’t that crowded when we arrived, but the whole process is still quite cumbersome.\n\nYou must also use a QR code to register if you want to use the famous rooftop pool. No access without first registering. By the way, after registering for a check in time and pool access, the hotel sends an SMS with confirmations. Of course, you must have an international phone plan that allows you to receive SMS messages.\n\nThe hotel room itself was nice enough. Spacious. Nothing particularly stands out as being a super expensive room, except we did have a fantastic view of the Marina Bay Gardens. Other than the view, it felt like any other convention hotel room I’ve ever stayed in.\n\nThe rooftop pool is as spectacular as all the pictures depict.\n\nAll in all, the hotel has a very Las Vegas feel to it - massive, crowded, casino and hyper-expensive shopping mall, nightly water and light shows. It was ok for one visit, but I wouldn’t pay that much to stay there again.",

The room was on the 46 floor with views on both sides that is the city and gardens by the bay. Amazing and breathtaking views; the room upkeep was disappointing, it felt old and technologically outdated. In room dining was below average however the breakfast at the lobby was excellent.  Overall 3 stars only for the views but felt this hotel to be overpriced in respect to the room and the facilities you receive.",

We were greeted by Sara(FOSARASVSI), front desk clerk who was very polite, professional and a true gem during our check-in process. We purchased the REIMAGINE Package at the time of booking (3nights) and did not realize this was going to be the biggest headache.\nSara explained that we must visit an agent within the hotel to redeem our REIMAGINE package/card/etc. , then proceed to any Silver Kiosk to print vouchers for daily redemption (breakfast, lunch, etc.)\n\nAfter 4 hours of travel, I was not pleased to hear we had to go on a scavenger hunt in this massive hotel/ casino for an expensive package we purchased.\n\nMy husband and I walked down to the Casio( Near Metro/711) to find the nearest agent, then we were questioned if we had a MBS rewards card. The agent reluctantly proceeded to print a card and then instruct us to find a silver kiosk for vouchers. We spent approx. 1 hour with this process.\n\nWe returned to the desk to speak with a manager about the inefficient, cumbersome process  of redeeming the package purchased. She walked us to the nearest un user friendly kiosk to help us print vouchers ( We desired early am breakfast and did not want to run around the hotel early morning to redeem).\n\nIn addition, the room electronics were nice but too much. Motion light sensors continuously came on during the night while moving in bed. The power to the electric toilet went out (2nd day) and there was no manual flush. I had to take 30 flights down to the lobby restroom , so I did not embarrass anyone while maintenance worked on the toilet electronics.\nIn addition, we had reservations at one of the restaurants on 57th floor and if you get off on the wrong side of the elevators be prepared to deal with the pool police not allowing you to walk across without room key in hand. The staff was not useful in directing us to the restaurant location.\n\nThe last day on check out ,we were bringing our luggage to the lobby and was a approached by Mr. Jeevan Rao, Manager, Service Management., he was the true angel that redeemed a frustrating stay for us. I explained our disappointing experience while we were checking luggage for hold and he immediately whisk us to the VIP lounge. Mr. Rao was so kind, polite and exemplified the upmost professionalism in customer service.\nWe were gifted lunch in the VIP section of Rise Restaurant, where we met Mr. Daniel Whitelaw , General Manager Rise Restaurant such an amazing personality and a truly kind person. He made sure we were comfortable, our needs were met during our lunch. We were truly  grateful to have met such an exceptional team that cared about our experience.\n\n***** 5 stars to Sara, Mr. J. Rao,  Mr. Daniel Whitelaw ,Concierge desk for exceptional service!\n\n***     3 stars for Marina Bay Sands for inconsiderate policies ,process and operations.",

The view from our room was quite worth the money!! Check in was  slow due to very long queue but the staff was friendly and helpful! Due to covid situ they only allow one hour slots in the pool which you will need to book before you go to the hotel.. The jacuzzi was less crowded in the morning.. The ambience in the restaurants are lovely but the food is quite pricy..The hotel rooms were very cosy and the bed was comfortable.. You can never get bored during a staycation at this hotel as there is such alot to do and roam around in places like the shoppes, and the hotel lobby area, infinity pool area!  An easy way to reach the hotel is through the Bayfront MRT incase you take public transport.. Highly recommend this hotel and I encourage everyone to book a stay here.. You will not regret!",

There's always gonna be something for everyone to do. For the gamblers, the casino is just around the corner. For the foodies, there is a plethora of amazing food options. And for the families with children, there are loads of activities for children to enjoy.",

After a long vacation in Indonesia, I was excited to kick my feet up and relax in this gorgeous hotel. Check in went smoothly, and I was greeted by a luxurious room and bathroom. For almost $1,000 USD a night, all I wanted was some peace and quiet. This was not the case. Hotel staff barged into my room not once, but TWICE, both times I was undressed and yelling at the top of my lungs to please wait as I collected myself. The first was partially my fault as I had slept through the alarm to go downstairs and extend my stay, however after YELLING repeatedly to wait, they still came in. The second time, the front desk made no attempt to communicate with housekeeping that I had indeed extended it. Come to find out, the front desk thought I wanted to change my key card (?) even though I handed over my passport and credit card and said I am paying for the room extension. As a female traveling alone, with past trauma with men, this was NOT the experience I wanted. I am deeply upset. I spoke to the manager, Atlan, who offered me a complimentary breakfast and taxi to apologize for the event, and we later settled for $150 Singapore dollars ($109 USD) in credit towards the room fare. It is a bit disappointing to know that the traumatic event and violation was only worth that much in his eyes. My room service server, Balan, was very kind and helpful, along with the bell hops I had the pleasure of meeting. Do not get me wrong, the hotel is exquisite, however, I will not be coming back again.",

You sure get what you pay for and this place is a testament to that saying.\n\nFrom the moment we arrived, my wife and I were greeted like first class. We arrived in a taxi and there were two hotel greeters that opened our doors. They took our bags and told us that it’ll be waiting for us in the room.\n\nEveryone (hotel workers) was super nice and respectful. Your definitely treated like kings and queens here. This place is more of like a resort. There’s soo much to do and see. From casinos, to shopping, the gardens by the bay, night clubs, and the fine dining. Did I also mention the infinity pool? Yes, we to paid to stay here for the infinity pool like most people do.\n\nOverall, if your going to travel to Singapore and wanna get the full “Singapore” experience then I encourage that you do stay at least one or two nights at the Marina Bag Sands. You don’t come here often and maybe once in a lifetime, so I do recommend staying here. Besides the wonderful food Singapore has to offer, this was the nightlight of our vacation.\n\nShoutout to the front desk person who helped us checked in, Caine! Super friendly and knowledgeable. He gave us a bunch of advice, tips, and things to do during our stay. He even was able to find us a room for early check in. Thanks Caine!",

Overall this is a worst hotel and experience.",

        "review_text": "Booked for 3D2N for my partner’s birthday. Really loved the check in and pool reservation booking system which was easy and seamless! As we were waiting at the lobby for our Queue number to be called, a FO staff asked for our Queue number and informed us there were 2 more guests ahead of us.\n\nOur check in staff was Alice. Her service was excellent! As she processed our booking, she noticed the date and it was my partner’s birthday which I didn’t mention upon reservation. Alice wished him Happy Birthday and upgraded us from Premier Garden view to Premier Harbour view and explained it’s on the higher floor. She also extended our check out time from 11am to 1pm which we did not have to ask. She explained the hotel’s facilities really well and also informed us a complimentary birthday cake will be sent to our room. We checked in at 2.35pm.\n\nOur room was on 44th floor, it was big, clean and has a really breathtaking view. We went out for dinner and when we came back, there was a birthday cake on the table. Huang Xiu was the Housekeeping staff in charge for our room. On day 2, he rang our bell at about 3-4pm and spoke in mandarin which I had difficulty understanding. He pointed at the “Make Up Room” button which I told him he doesn’t need to make up the room. We went out for dinner, came back and the room was made up. Huang Xiu had replenished the towels, amenities & bar items. What I appreciate was, he placed the new bath mat at the exact spot I placed the used one.\n\nThe infinity pool was obviously beyond amazing. Booking for the time slots was easy and so was cancelling a slot which we did due to heavy rain. The staff at the infinity pool were all so friendly. My partner asked the Lifeguard which way is the washroom. The lifeguard, got down from his seat just to tell him the way.\n\nI would also like to add that we went to Ce La Vi and each staff from the first floor, the counter and the waitress & waitresses that served our drinks were great! Also, Muhammad Fitri had been really helpful during our stay and also called the room to wish my partner a Happy Birthday.\n\nOverall, MBS was a fantastic experience for us and for my partner’s birthday and each of the staff we met along way even if it was a small gesture, can be felt with warmth and sincerity.",

I had to engage with the hotel reception and despite them calling security to the room they were unable to stop the issue for 3 hours. This ruined my stay and the only compensation I was offered was an upgrade next time I stay. I feel that a more appropriate gesture would have been to refund a quarter of the cost of my stay. I engaged with the customer service team but they have not responded to my requests for appropriate compensation. Given the cost of staying at MBS I have high expectations regarding customer service and based on my experience these were not met.\n\nI would not recommend staying at MBS.",

        "review_text": "This iconic hotel is very near to airport, approx 15 mins by Taxi, so great location to explore city.  Lots of communal areas with shops and a Casino, plus a SkyPark (aka SkyDeck), but we found these and the lobby areas nearly always crowded, with hardly anywhere to sit, so if you are looking for a 5 star hotel with relaxing, quite public areas this one is not recommended. Had to queue for check-in and no welcome drink but room was comfortable (nothing special, more like 4 Star) and spacious, but on sixth floor, opposite the highway, so if you book this floor be prepared for some background road noise. AC a little noisy, but kept room cool. House-keeping excellent and kept room spotless. Room Key-cards can be temperamental so keep away from your mobile phone in pocket or handbag, unless you enjoy 20 min excursions to lobby with inevitable queues to recharge. Huge infinity pools (x3) with amazing views of city below and beyond, best one on 57th floor. Pools are open from 6am till 11pm, however be aware that they are not heated and can get very crowded during peak times when “selfie” mania takes over. Also not that it can take a few lift changes to get to them depending on where your room is. The Skypark is great fun, providing a great panoramic view of the city, especially at night. Highly recommend the morning Yoga class just for the fantastic vista. Note that SkyPark is open to public too, not just Hotel guests. If you don’t mind bustling crowds, location, city views and infinity pools are indeed 5 Star, else for service, room and value we’d rate more like 4 Star.",

Shoppers can choose anything from a simple supermarket to high end branded products in this mall.\nThere is pretty much everything and anything here. There are a lot of high end restaurants here too and they have Michelin starred restaurants in this mall too.\nOutside of the mall, there is also a light show at stipulated timings and this attracts a huge crowd of tourists.\nFamilies can also opt to bring their children to the nearby ArtScience museum for the Future World exhibition. There is also a schedule of musicals/performances in the ever popular MasterCard theatre.\nOne thing to note of this mall, as there is a huge crowd of shopper flow, the taxi stand may sometimes have a long wait. In addition the toilets may not be of clean standards as it is not possible for the cleaning attendants to keep up their cleaning as the place has too many patrons. Toilet paper may be lacking too due to the same reason.",

A must do they say...\nI couldn't be more disappointed by the service and how they handle the situation. They constantly check on you to stay away from people but... have nothing in place to speed up the check in process (other hotels in town will have automated kiosks, roaming staff or online check in to speed it up).\nWe queued literally for 1 hour to check in. Process was soooo tedious... unbelievable for a property of this size. Staff are obviously not trained.\nThis was for our honeymoon as a gift from friends and despite their request early in advance, nothing was done. Not a card, not the slightest attention. Such a disappointment for a hotel of that so called 5 star level.\nNot only this is overrated but they haven't figured out how to handle the situation at all. For a place of that size and all the PR they do... needless to say that we were expecting something at least decent.\nHours of wait to get to the pool, with not even control on it so we are not even sure we will be allowed up at any point of our stay. Price is not down but stay hours are reduced (check in 3 pm and out by 11 am...).\nRooms are dated but decent.\nView is spectacular from either side, that's the only star I can give...\nStay away everyone... other places will give you a way better value.",

To avoid disappointment, it is advisable to book ahead of your stay. I emailed the hotel to obtain the booking details and booked weeks before check in. The view is fantastic so don't miss it.\nb) you also need to book a slot to exercise @ the gym via sms. The difference between booking the pool and the gym is that there are pre-defined slots to go to the pool while it is go when it is your turn for the gym.The view @ the gym is fantastic too so don't miss it.\nc) entry to and out to the lifts to go back to your room is screened\nd) it is good to book dining venues too, particularly popular restaurants like Ce La Vi.\n\nAs for the room, we found the offerings dated, particularly the TV entertainment. Perhaps they could offer Netfix programme. The room is otherwise spacious and comfortable. Our rooms face Gardens by the bay and this side is where you can veiw sunrise.

Faith at the Tower 1 check in desk provided outstanding service. Although they did not have a room ready for us, Faith set us with temp key cards so we could freshen up in the fitness center and use the pool. That was very welcome after our red eye flight in. We were told we would get a call when our room was ready so we chilled at the pool and hot tub taking advantage of the awesome views. Never received a call so we came back at normal check in time, 3pm to get our room. The front desk said the room had been available since this morning which was a bit disappointing. Anyways, our luggage was already delivered to the room.  When I checked my email, MBS sent a mid stay survey. Thinking nothing of it, I filled out the survey and mentioned I was disappointed in not getting a call and this is where their service shined. Within a few minutes of submitting the survey, I got a call Nicole in Service Management. This has never happened. She wanted to know more so they could improve and how she could make it up to us. I declined her offer and told her I just wanted to provide constructive feedback. She insisted on making our stay memorable and indeed she did. She sent us a bottle of champagne, provided us with a 1pm late check out and arranged a car for us to go to the airport. I even mentioned I was planning on pushing back our dinner reservation at Rise and she took care of that for us. Nicole did help us realize that although I never got a call, I was sent an email about the room being ready that went to my junk. Good thing she didn’t hold it against me. Pro tip: Don’t forget to check your junk mail.Thank you to Nicole, Faith, and the entire staff at MBS. Your dedication to service makes you stand out. You will be at the top of my list anytime I’m in Singapore.",

        "review_text": "Great experience overall! Room is immaculate, housekeeping is speedy, food is great (Please try the breakfast potateos at SPAGO!) but 2 negatives.\n\nParking situation at MBS was horrible (15/12,). It was frustrating and I was late for check in at 2.30pm by about 30 mins. I approached a short hair Filipino service staff at the hotel for help with check in but was told the next check in time will be at 5pm and I will be the last in line for that time slot and she was \"sorry\" she can't do anything about it! That is an additional 2 hours wait with my luggage and I have Gardens by the bay booking at 4.30pm! I had hope to freshen up before I visit GBTB! She advised us to leave our luggage and \"have some coffee\" for 2 hours. I know I am late for check in with very good reason but to make me wait for a further 2 hours and give some ridiculous advise of coffee for 2 hours just to check in? I am in the service line for 20 years and I did not sense any hallmarks of quality service from her, she has failed to understand my problem from my POV and stuck to the rules of check in timing to the letter. No empathy at all This is just a staff drawing salary and giving lip service to MBS guest. Why bother to be in \"customer service\" industry when a robot running on smart contract can do the same exact job? Why station a human at the check in area if you can't solve a guest problem with a human approach?\n\nI did not make a big fuss and cooled off for 5 mins at the side before I approached another tall bald Indian service staff. I explained myself like I did to the Filipino staff and he helped me to a physical queue for check in. He understood my pain and took immediate action that cost nothing to MBS to solve my problem. The room was already ready and it ONLY took 5 mins for the counter staff to check us in. This fact pisses me off even further with the short hair Filipino staff. It is comforting and good to know that there are some staff at MBS that understood customer service and they will always have my thanks and appreciation. But not to those that just pay lip service to \"quality service\".\n\nSecond would be the Infinity pool booking. I understand it is peak period with the holidays but the booking system is flawed. I stayed there for 3D2N and failed to book a 2nd slot for the 2nd day at check in. I refreshed the booking at every chance I get but did not see any slots opening up. My concern is, there isn't any penalty with no show and that is fine (its okay there shouldnt be a penalty for no show) but the empty slots that are no show could be better used for walk ins. If I walk in and get rejected because it is full, its fine but if the pool is not full and I get rejected as a walk in for my entitled booking, that isn't right.",

One week before our stay I could booked the pool online as all slots are unavailable. On thé day when I checked in, I told the manager I was upset that I couldn’t visit the pool. Jessica was very helpful. She asked to give her some time and see what she could do. She managed to get a time slot for 3 persons in the pool. I was very thankful to her. Really appreciate her help. We got a free upgrade to deluxe king room facing the garden on the 49th floor. The room is big with an awesome balcony view. When I booked the hotel, i wrote in comment that it was my wedding anniversary. We got complimentary lovely chocolate cake and a coffee cup made of chocolate. So wonderful. There were so much things to do. We need to book a slot for the gym, a slot sauna/hot tub for female and free access to the sky park observation deck. We also had a good dinner at Spargo. Origin + Bloom has fantastic sandwiches n breakfast options where hotel guests got 20% discount. I recommend Early Riser bun. Overall, it’s a marvellous stay here.",

No other piece of modern architecture is more iconic than MBS in Southeast Asia and I had my eyes set.\n\nIn just the few days before the Christmas holiday, Nicole was offered to connect with my 3rd party photographer and help coordinate the proposal as if I asked my best friend one favor in my lifetime. She is an amazing human and I can tell why MBS is lucky to have her be the face of their iconic brand.\n\nNicole granted permission for my photographer to be at the Sky Observatory Deck for the special moment when I popped the question. She even kept in communication with my photographer on a 2 hour photoshoot to surprise us with a generous gift with chilled champagne and truffle chocolates in our room when we returned.\n\nThe property itself is fantastic - from the intimate infinity pools, to the world-class architecture in the casino, to the immense amount of beautiful shops in the mall. Oh, and we cannot forget the delicious food at the food courts.\n\nThe experience at the property was far superior than the hundreds (yes hundreds) of times that I've visited in Las Vegas.

Really upset with the STRICTLY NO EXCEPTION rule even after I explained to them the purpose of visit. Though it had happened a number of years back, this experience unfortunately left a very deep but negative impression in my mind.\n\n2) The casino could not offer much help to a non-gambling person (that's me) who needed help to look for her mother whose whereabout in the casino became a question mark. I could do nothing but to wait outside the exit area. This occurred last month (29th April 2023)",

Expect to pay extra for the same stuff elsewhere just because of the location but if you do buy regularly, get the Sands Rewards card to get cashback. Many levels and there is an indoor river where you can get rides. I recommend visiting the food court on the bottom level for good food.",

The hotel boasts stunning views of the city skyline, including the iconic Marina Bay Sands infinity pool on the 57th floor, which is one of the most famous rooftop swimming pools in the world. I enjoyed a variety of dining options, from casual eateries to fine dining restaurants, as well as a shopping mall with designer boutiques and a casino. The hotel also has a full-service spa and fitness center, and I took advantage of the nearby attractions such as Gardens by the Bay and the ArtScience Museum. With all of these features and amenities, my staycation at Marina Bay Sands was truly unforgettable.",

Granted I had a huge corner room with a wonderful view which was nice but that's where it ends. The finishing was basic and not in the least luxurious. The bed was OK but the bedding lacked the plushness that I would expect from a hotel of this calibre. In particular the duvet felt thin and old.\n\nI truly appreciate that all towels were individually shrink wrapped, probably because of covid right now but it would appear that they have eschewed fabric softener. The towels were old and frankly the roughest I've used in a 5 star hotel.\n\nSadly the housekeeping was also sadly lacking. The mini bar and snacks were to have been replenished daily. Although the bar was replenished the snacks were not and we had to ask for it. What really surprised me though was the housekeeping staff entered the room without knocking while we were in the room. Used their master key and came right in to bring us our snacks.\n\nMBS you need to up your game.",

The taste was a mixture of conflicting spices that made the sauce not so rich and delicious but rather thin, over powering with a bitter/tannin after taste on the tongue. Personally love dipping and would say I have a generally accepting palate for curry and can respect any decent butter chicken, Tika Masala, gram masala etc, but this place was bad. What got me was their fresh cooked tandoori Naan. The Naan was decent, but the butter chicken was just awful. Went to the Ramen joint across the way... poor decision.  It said #1 Ramen in the world... what is wrong with me? Too trusting I guess. Ramen was nothing to write home about. The crispy corn was basically ribbed corn on the cob fried with tapioca or corn starch powder. Lacked flavor. Got seaweed fried for my kiddo, unsalted not crispy... enough said.\nBesides my poor food choices, the place was interesting to walk around. The casino is in there if that's a vice u like. All in all, it's like a urban hiking trip. Fun to window shop but you should really hit the hawker center for food. Satay stalls open at 0530pm~ Don't forget to go outside and take pics~\n\nPeace,\n\n~iWill",

        "review_text": "Policy and service was really bad, felt like I was going on a staycation at a prison instead. There were staffs stationed at every lift lobby to check our identity before entering, even had to announce our room number when we're exiting the lobby. What's worse is that the staffs infront of the lift lobbies just hate their job. Was told that visitors won't be allowed to enter the hotel after 10pm. My visitor arrived at the lift lobby at 9.50pm and was told \"visitors not allowed to enter after 9.45pm.\" and the staff immediately looked away after he finished the sentence. So is brushing someone off the kind of service MBS staffs are taught to provide? I went on to explain that I was told (during registration) that visitors will only be disallowed to enter AFTER 10pm, not 9.45pm, and was told to proceed opposite to use a telephone to speak to the \"front desk\". After which, the operator on the phone told me to proceed to Tower 1 to speak to the staffs at the front desk. So they're basically just asking us to walk back and forth. When I went to the front desk to explain the situation, the staff was polite (thankfully), and apologised for the miscommunication. She then told me that the only thing I can do is to pay $117 add a guest so that there's no restrictions, which I went on to pay the amount given. Afterwhich, I proceeded to bring my guest back to Tower 3 lift lobby, which we were allowed entry this time. However, I heard the staff (which rejected our entry previously) asking his colleague in Bahasa \"Can meh?\" or something similar. This kind of service is what you'll be getting in MBS.\n\nOh and not to mention that you're only given 6x 500ml of water per day, and when you request for more, it's $5 per bottle.",

This establishment is now one of the representation of Singapore and you can find here the magnificient one of a kind infinity pool.\n\nI will share with you some important aspect which i experienced recently.\n\nRoom - upon entering the assigned room, you will feel instantly the relax ambience of the unit, maybe because its spacious and interior is well curated. What im impressed most is the curtain will automatically open for you to have a look of its view outside, this is depends whether you have a gardens by the bay or a city view but both sides i believed is amazing. The bed is comfortable definitely your\nin to a good night sleep. The linen is fresh, T&B are squeky clean and you all have the things that you may need during your stay.\n\nStaff : as this is a three tower building establishment, a lot of staffing that they need. However, i am so impressed with the staff on how they look after each guest with the request that you are making. There is no delay and a quick reponse coordination among to all department.   In addition to that, they make sure that you are well attended and request is being delivered. A big salute of their team.\n\nAmenities - aside from the regular offering of this hotel, one of the main reasons why tourist or even local singaporean want to experience is the massive infinity pool. It is located on top of the tower, 57th floor to be exact. A truly magnificient view that will make your experience a remarkable one. While enjoying the pool, you will be amazed also with singapore skyline, the towering building, the names of the giant company, the orderly planning of its city. The view will give a peak or even an answer why this little dot is a truly example of a good governance.\n\nIf you really want a good staycation, i can highly recommend this property because they do offer most of what you need. From its infinity pool, a mall that most of international brands are present, experienced a hawker style to their makansutra food court which is open 24 hours, nearby tourist spots like garden by the bay, the merlion, esplanade among others, a light show at night, a cafe and restaurant, a casino, or even you want to have a quick run around the area is possible.\n\nIf we will tackle about the price, yes it is a bit pricey compare to its nearby hotels, but we need to take note that it is not only the hotel room that are covering, we are also paying a one of a kind experience that will surely remember by its guest.\n\nMarina Bay Sands  perfected the expectation of its hotel guest from a family, group or even solo traveller. I can recommend this to everyone who wants to visit Singapore, a one for the book experience that will give you a story to tell for a lifetime.\n\nWith this i am giving this hotel establishment a score of 10 out 10. And i cant wait for my next staycation again 🙏",

The control to go up is terrible because you're competing with 3 towers of people trying to go up to the pool - which is a must visit due to the awesome view.\n\nThey have an automated sms system where you sms this number and issue you a queue number to go up to the pool after 8am. No need to sms from 6 to 8am. But after 8am you have to get a queue number.\n\nOn our 1st day, we smsed at 1pm and only got a reply to go up at 10pm, same for the 2nd and 3rd day there even on a weekday.

It is styled after the high-style malls of Las Vegas and like, but along with that is that most of the shops are very high-end (Chanel, Gucci etc) and very tourist-oriented. There are no mid or low-end retail outlets (or very few) and also not that many casual Food and Beverage places like your usual Mr Bean. There is a food court on the end closer to the Art Science Museum and the chicken rice there is about 10 singapore dollars,  and still, very hard to find seats there during peak horus. The square footage is enormous (just like big US malls), and so you can walk very long if you want to go to just one specific shop.  This is a great place to bring visitors from out of town, you can split up and explore the mall for a few hours. The canal boat thing is so tourist and odd ,but i guess very good for photos. In the evening you can enjoy the light show right outside on the waterfront.  And don't forget, Gardens By The Bay is just next door.",

You can view Singapore CBD, and Marina Bay, including Singapore Merlion and The Esplanade.\n-A Light and water show at Marina Bay Sands is back, so it is an excellent spot to view the show without squeezing into the crowd.\n\nChoose Garden view if you like:\n-To see the beauty of the sunrise.\n-Sea view of Singapore straits, including Garden by the Bay, the light show at night time, and Batam Island from far far away.\n-Fresh air because the room has a balcony, a good spot for a smoker, you can hang your wet clothes as well, and an excellent place to relax in the late afternoon or evening with the fresh air.\n\nI wish you a Happy staycation!",

Check in is unnecessarily long and the staff does not explain terms of stay properly. The welcome staff at Spago are just horrible. Because the check in staff mucked up the process, we were confused about what we were entitled to or not, which the eye-rolling more-entitled staff were either unwillingly or passive-aggressively explaining.\n\nHonorable mentions - Fir (Spago) and Ridwan (Tower 3) - you are both stars. Otherwise, this would have been a 0 star review.\n\nExpect to spend 800 singapore bucks net per night for room. If you can navigate the confusing entitlements scheme (where you sign up to be an MBS Rewards member), you can shave off 70 dollars or so per night. For that same money per night, there are a dozen more deserving and better run hotels in Singapore run by friendly staff who excel at their job of being in the hospitality sector (and deserving of accolades).

The only con I could think of is the lack of refrigerator as the one in the room was reserve for the snacks and drinks that they were selling and the fridge has a sensor to track which item was removed and will charge you automatically however that is easily solved by requesting for a personal fridge for a one time fee of $10 SGD\n\nOverall I had an amazing stay and would visit again.",

We really appreciated this.\n\nRidwan (pool)\nAgain, ensured my sister and I were taken care of and checked on us to ensure all was well. He was a really lovely person, and Havis and him made a great team.\n\nRyan, Fir, Brandon and Jenny (pool)\nWhat an incredible team of people who take a genuine interest in their guests. They all offered to take pictures for us and didn’t rush us whatsoever. Their presence at the pool made sure that my sister and I felt comfortable and content the entire time we were guests on the roof.\n\nNelly (Spa)\nI had a facial with Nelly and was blown away by the care and time taken. She truly knows her craft and the treatment pleasantly included a foot bath and mini head and shoulder massage.\nNelly made me feel completely at ease and it felt so luxurious the entire way through.\nShe also gave practical tips and advice on how to maintain my skincare following the treatment, not pushing to buy products as I have had before. This will remain one of my favourite facial treatments for a long time.\n\nMani (Bellhop/Porter)\nWhat a genuinely lovely young man. Very accommodating, cheerful and professional.

There was a two seater beside a four seater sofa which was a little too close for comfort, near the serving area where the staff gathers. Food was good. Noodles were salty. The wrapping skin was very nice. Could not see clearly in the dark, almost ate the paper separating the skins. Wines were slightly pricey.",

At a Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf in the basement floor, I enjoyed sipping perhaps one of the tastiest vanilla lattes.",

Awkward going back and forth between the different elevators and keys that constantly had to be rekeyed. \"Late\" checkout was 12pm, and if you expect to be served upon as a luxury hotel once you get there, forget it. Expext to be treated as a number, and you'll be OK.

We had a wonderful experience in these 3 days. Every staff members I encountered from the valets, bellmen, housekeepers, slot ambassadors to concierge ambassadors, they were performing excellent services and eager to help us out anytime. Our room was spacious and spotless with good garden view. We enjoyed a lot at the infinity pool, jacuzzi and skypark. Suggest the time of your jacuzzi sessions can be extended from 15min to 30 min.\n\nUnfortunately, only one of your front desk receptionists was really made us speechless and fedup just upon the day we check-in.\n\nWe were served by counter 4 at about 2:30pm-2:45pm. We need to fill up a form for check-in purpose. I believe that she still a NEWBIE?\n\nI was checking with my fiance if the name is written correctly, how dare she giving us a rude comment by asking,  \"你男朋友的全名你也不知道啊？\"\n\nWe were stunned and totally can't believe that we just received an insult gift from a FIVE stars hotel receptionist, just the first day we check-in.\n\nThings were not getting better but getting worse instead.\n\nMy fiance mentioned to her that we were actually getting married tomorrow. No blessings received, another unexpected words came out from her mouth AGAIN. She looked at my finger and said I was not even wearing ANY RING. She told me that I should wear my ring so she can know that I AM ENGAGED.\n\nAnother rude comments from her mouth by saying, “Waaaa, your husband soon but you don't know his full name.“\n\nThis is how a FIVE stars hotel, Marina Bay Sands provided us an unforgettable first impression. =) Thanks to her. Management should train her more about MANNERS and COMMON SENSE before assign her to serve your valued guests. I believe that she was not well-trained enough.\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐\nWe will definitely be back for staycation but certaintly hope that we won't receive such rude comments to start off our day again.",

Unfortunately, the receipt was with my sister and she had left earlier. I also had a picture of proof receipt. With no chance of redeeming the parking coupon, I was forced to pay about $9 of parking. They told me I could claim back $4 the next time I come or through email. Howevern that would mean in the end I would still be losing time and money to go through all the hassle when I redeemed a full amount of $27 for the parking.\n\nIt was unjust and unfair as there wasn't any notice to present receipt upon leaving as you could just redeem using the rewards card at the usual carpark south. It was due to poor communication from the management. To make it aware to customers using the carpark. If I had known, I would gladly have parked at the other carpark entrances.\n\nUtterly disappointed as they could have helped me instead of leaving me with no option but to pay the full fee.

The lunch buffet was amazing with so much choice, it's a self service buffet so you could try anything you fancied. The seafood station was amazing and I could have filled up there. The deserts were to die for and the chef was very accomodating in cutting me half portions from two cakes as I was spoilt for choice. I look bed the cordial station as well where you could add fruit. A lovely experience, would thoroughly recommend and will definitely return.",

Have introduced my contact from Australia and highly recommended him to try Japanese food at Koma.\n\nHe was wearing expensive designer sandals due to his leg injury on that day. When we reached Koma's entrance, a lady at the reception stopped and told us strictly that the dress code policy is \"Gentlemen must wear closed shoes and long trousers\" and \"Ladies and gentlemen, don't wear flip flops.\". She restricted us with two options on either buying a new pair of closed shoes for admission or just simply cancel the appointment off. We were utterly unbearable and impossible to communicate and negotiate with her in the absence of customer servicing at all.\n\nDoes the policy discriminate and not welcome people who wear sandals and with disabilities? If this is the standing, please properly state and spell out clearly within the policy that sandals are not strictly allowed. I can say that \"Policy is fixed, but human mindset is alive\". Should Koma staff don't change their mentality and remain inflexible, \"customer service\" can hardly be labelled. Unfortunately, I encounter such unpleasant experience at Koma.\n\nWe faced with entrance rejection flatly for Koma dining and left with no choice but visit another eatery - Bistro & Oyster Bar. Despite the fact that receptionist over there mentioned the dress code policy as well, they wholeheartedly understood, showed empathy and accepted my contact's medical disabilities without any trace of discrimination. I seriously in doubt on how well establishment and highly prestige Koma assumes and rates itself but nevertheless in my opinion, Bistro & Oyster Bar offers a much more professional customer service and provide appetizing food.\n\nWith such a terrible and awful experience, I will not recommend anyone and visit Koma again. I do sincerely hope that the Management of Marina Bay Sands can advise your Partners/Tenants to provide more professional flexible and customer services and allow customers to enjoy their good moments when shopping and dining at Marina Bay Sands.",

The suite included the club facilities we wanted and granted us preferred slots for the pool as well. The extra costs were definitely worth it and the whole Marina Bay Sands experience was amazing. So my tip: book a suite to get the best service.\n--------------------------------------\nWe are supposed to arrive tomorrow in Marina Bay Sands, but until now everything is going wrong. We booked a clubroom on the website in the beginning of August. Today I find out the system did not book us a clubroom. What I did: after selecting clubroom and then date, I selected the roomtype. Turns out these are not clubrooms because they are not available. But there wasn't any sign on the website that informed me I was not booking a website. When talking to reservations today I was not offered help, instead I was informed repeatedly (approx 15-20 times) the clubroom was not available anymore. I got that the first time. But I was not offered a solution. The problem created by the hotel's website was made my problem. Not the kind of customer service you expect from a 5 star hotel with high prices.\nThen I read the email I received at 9.17 this morning about prebooking the pool and check-in time. By the time I filled out of the information like names, confirmation and pasport numbers, I received the available slots. I was flabbergasted. More than 24 hours before our arrival I was only to book 1 slot on Sunday for the pool: from 6.00-7.15 AM!!!! Are you kidding me? I hope the hotel will arrange a suitable solution. Fingers crossed. This is unacceptable for a 5 star hotel with price starting at 500 SGD per night.",

And I suggested them to free upgrade me since it’s not my fault, finally mention to me will change and upgrade my room. So I went to another room it’s the same room type, why lie to me at the first place and go through a few hours of waiting. Really disappointed!!! Worst than even a 1 star hotel.

A chinese-speaking lady who's helping at the queue seemed to have communication issues - instead of showing hospitality and professionalism, she portrayed sarcasm. We are aware that we missed the queue but she had to keep reiterating it without giving us a solution initially. It's only after we asked whether we can get another queue number (solution came from us?) and she exclaimed rudely: \"YES I WILL GIVE YOU AND I'M ARRANGING IT FOR YOU NOW!\" She speaks English but had a thick Chinese accent. Eventually we gotten sort of a service recovery when we were ushered into the VIP Guests Services Lounge for checking in. Staff in there were nice.\n\nLobby services (concierge, bellboy, carpark valet etc) - 1/5: Ordered Grabfood but items went missing. 0 communications between departments and 0 hospitality given to my wife. The staff simply asked my wife to check on her own. A simple call or maybe thru walkie talkies can be really helpful no? Ended up making my wife ran (literally) from tower 1 to 3 and back to tower 1. Shouldn't all staff simply direct her to the concierge to assist?\n\nRoom service - 3/5: After finally retrieving our food, we called to request for cutleries but it didn't came until like 30 mins later. Had to call in twice to chase for it.\n\nPool - 5/5: Compliments to a staff at the pool gantry who's especially nice and friendly - forgotten his name sadly.\nGym - 5/5: View and equips were great.\nIf only we had more time for both of them.\n\nRoom itself was nice, neat and clean - 5/5 (city view tower 1)\nBreakfast @ Spago was awesome. Had sumptuous choices and tasted great. Staff there were nice too - 5/5",

Being a 2 year old, he obviously wanted to keep it despite us not wanting to purchase it. We ended up paying $30 for a piece of plastic with low resolution pictures in it.\n\nWhat a dirty trick to sell souvenirs to tourists - through child manipulation. I encourage you to skip the sampan ride. If you absolutely must ride it, watch out for the scam artist that will slip a souvenir into the hands of your child so you’re manipulated to purchase it.\n\nI will not be visiting this tourist trap again.",

I often walk so much I get blisters on my feet and don't care. So much to see! Every big name fashion house, every sparkly bauble and watch store, celebrity chef eatery, yup. Tis all here. Do consider dressing up slightly when you visit. A tourist in a tube top and holey shorts plus dirty flipflops looks, feels, and (sorry) smells out of place here. This is where you go to get your glam on. Do it! Enjoy the experience, even if you buy nothing.\nThey also have a huge eating area on one of the lower levels, toy and clothing stores, and for families with kids, an astounding electronic whimsical sort of skate rink (no ice, your feet moving affects a design on the floor).\nIf you like architecture,  inside and out this place should be studied. It is truly a marvel. Love it for the openness, the designer shops, the modern fabulousness and especially for over the top nice, helpful and friendly concierge desks who will help you along the way.",

There is no need for reservations for the pool anymore, and the best time to go is sunset / sunrise for the photos. Pro-tip: bring a selfie stick. At Spago for breakfast, Ken was a truly amazing server- he catered to my nut allergies and made sure our cup was always full. That type of service is unmatched!",

Doesnt it more risk to get same room person to join another queue to book?\n\n2- They didnt inform upfront the infinity Pool is full until you book.\n\n3- The queue is call up once your turn, so i cannot preplan my event of day and had to sit there wait for queue whole day in room?\n\nHope MBS will relook this type of system and maybe follow others hotel standard how the booking works.",

Room side said we could claim Another 60bucks from 3rd night. But rewards side said it is not applicable.\nInfo given to guests should be consistent.\n\nUpon checkout as well, card rewards point are not updated while we can see on apps. Checkout counter indian lady is so rude in the way she told us that there is no point in the card. Will we ask for points offset when there is zero?\n\nReally unpleasant experience dealing with 2 set of people.

However, when our friend visited us on the 2nd day, he was denied access, as his name was not in the system and another staff at the check in counter informed us that “pre-registering of visitors is NOT ALLOWED”. In the end, we had to queue at the check in counter to register our friend every single day. While I understand that the restrictions put in place are to safeguard the hotel stayers, it’s absolutely disappointing to see the lack of SOPs from a five star hotel.\n\nThat aside, i called the express service in the morning to request for additional bottled water, as there were 3 adults staying but was told that additional charges apply.

Our room has a balcony which has an amazing view and where you can stay if you want to just relax and enjoy the view. What I like least about this hotel is that\nno one cares to welcome and assist you as you enter the hotel. No assistance with our baggage as well. No shuttle service.

It does leave you quite overwhelmed with the sheer size and scale of the complex. It's worth heading over to this location as a part of the Marina Bay area overall, but I found The Shoppes to be similar to any major mall and wouldn't spend any particular time here. Shopping enthusiasts of high-end and luxury labels will be spoilt for choice by what feels like an endless supply of shopping outlets and restaurants.\n\nThere are some great art installations dotted around the complex, including a fantastic interactive piece by teamLab, which responds to pressure points that visitors stand on (a favourite of young children).\n\nFootpaths on the main road are nearly non-existent (aside from pedestrian areas) and requires using the shopping mall to get around the Marina Bay area.

The views from the observation deck or even just around the promenade area are incredible, especially at night when the skyline lights up.\n\nEven if you’re not staying at the hotel, there’s so much to explore — the Shoppes, the food court, the canal, and of course the light and water show outside.

This replaces the Evening Canapés ( which was available only at MBS hotel ).\n\nThe Aperitif Hour ( 5pm-7pm ), plus Breakfast ( 6.30am-10am ) and afternoon tea ( 3pm-5pm ) are made available FOC to guests staying in certain room types.\n\nIn the past 5 weeks, I have tried 5 of the restaurants that participated in the Aperitif Hour. Of the 5 restaurants, I tried 2 of them twice, because they are just so good.\n\nMy reviews, in descending order of ranking , are as follows :-\n\n1.Bread Street Kitchen ( BSK )\n———————————————-\nI tried BSK twice over 5 weeks.\nOf all the Aperitif Hour participating restaurants, this is the BEST ! 👍👍👍\n\nEven though it was only 5pm, the restaurant has a busy and vibrant feel, with courteous staff attending to the needs of diners, who are happily chatting away. This is a happy place 😀😀😀.\n\nBeing a Gordon Ramsay restaurant, the food is, of course, very good. I am very happy that they served their in-house focaccia bread ( with humus ) first, before the arrival of our main orders of Sunday Roast Yorkies, Mini Fish & Chips, and Wagyu Burger Sliders. The delicious focaccia and humus makes the wait for the main orders so much bearable 😜.\n\nEven though it is supposed to be Aperitif Hour, the food BSK served is of such a good size that we skipped dinner thereafter.\n\nThe Wagyu Burger Sliders are so good, that we ordered it both times we are there. ( My dining companion thinks it can give Cut’s Wagyu Sliders a run for their money, but I have to, ahem, differ lah 😅 ).\n\nEven though we did not order any alcoholic beverages ( it’s part of the package ), I note they have a wide selection for connoisseurs. The non-alcoholic Ginger De Pooh, and Belini Junior are refreshingly good.\n\nI will return to BSK for Aperitif Hour or a main meal during my next stay at MBS. 😋😋😋\n\n2.Wakuda\n—————-\nI also tried Wakuda twice over 5 weeks.\n\nWakuda has an understated and quiet elegance. At 5pm, it’s not crowded or busy ( unlike BSK ), and I think many diners may like Wakuda exactly for that.\n\nBeing a sister restaurant to Waku Ghin, its food is very good. I have dined there many times, so having Aperitif Hour at Wakuda allows me to have a different experience there.\n\nI really like their Wagyu Cigar, which is yummy 😋. Their Karage Chicken is extra crispy and delicious .\n\nWakuda is a really good restaurant.\nI will definitely return for a sumptuous dinner with close friends and family… soon.\n\n3.Koma\n————-\nWhen I am served with the food , I am blown away by their presentation… it came on a mini version of their iconic bridge ( which is the backdrop of countless photos of many diners there ). What a nice touch. 👍\n\nWe had the Aperitif Hour at the Bar Lounge instead of the main dining area. The wagyu slider is very good but the portions are relatively small.\n\nI look forward to return to Koma for a main meal again.\n\n4.Yardbird\n——————\nThe quality of the food is good, and the portions are big enough that I skipped dinner thereafter.\n\nI am surprised by the quality and spread of the food at Yardbird, which I have never visited before. I may now visit Yardbird in the near future.\nAt 5pm, the restaurant is relativity quiet.\n\n5.Maison Boulud\n—————————\nWhen I arrived at 5pm, the service staff  assigned me a seat near a window which is scorching hot from the afternoon sun.\n\nThe food portions are very small and the quality average.\n\nThe restaurant itself is very quiet, with only 2 staff serving customers at 5pm.\n\nComments\n——————-\nThe newly introduced Aperitif Hour is a brilliant idea !!!\n\nThis gives the hotel guests a chance to try the excellent food served by the restaurants based at the mall and hotel. Also, it provides the restaurants some business during the quiet hour of 5pm-6pm. A win-win-win for all. 👍👍👍\n\nI look forward to Aperitif Hour being introduced at Cut, Spago, Black Tap etc. 😀😀😀",

Unfortunately, it was a disappointing experience.\n\nOn the first day, we waited for two full hours during check-in because the hotel said our room had a smoke odor. As compensation, we were given USD 150.\n\nHowever, on the second night, we noticed the room still had a strong smell of smoke. The manager brought in a machine, saying it used a “natural solution” to remove the odor. I told them this was unacceptable—we have a child, and we couldn’t tolerate this for the rest of our holiday. I requested a room change or an upgrade, but the manager only said they would report it and then completely ignored us afterward.\n\nThis is the second time this year we’ve stayed here as a family, but sadly, it will be the last. A hotel of this level should take better care of its guests.",

It came with a Dyson hairdryer in the closet, an automated smart toilet (it opens the lid as you approach!), and wireless charging pads built right within the tabletop. The room was absolutely spotless and super comfortable.\nA special shoutout to the Front office team and in‑room dining team for arranging a cake and red wine to celebrate our wedding anniversary—such a thoughtful and memorable gesture.

My amazing boyfriend, Donkey, surprised me with a stay at the luxurious MBS Hotel Suites, and the entire experience was pure bliss! From the moment we arrived, we were enveloped in an atmosphere of unparalleled elegance and sophistication. The suite itself was breathtaking & spacious, impeccably designed, and boasting floor to ceiling windows offering stunning panoramic views of the city skyline and Gardens by the Bay. The plush furnishings, state of the art amenities (I especially loved the deep-soaking tub!), and the sheer opulence of the space created an unforgettable experience. Simply relaxing and enjoying the breathtaking views was pure bliss. The service was generally impeccable, the staff were friendly, attentive, and always ready to assist with a smile. Dining at one of the hotel's many exceptional restaurants was a highlight, and the Sands Skypark infinity pool provided an unforgettable backdrop for a celebratory swim.  The only minor drawback was a slight delay in room service, we requested shower gel via the in-room TV system and waited approximately 45 minutes before having to call directly to expedite the request. However, this small inconvenience was easily overshadowed by the overall magnificence of our stay. Overall, the MBS Hotel Suites delivered an extraordinary experience, making it the most memorable birthday celebration ever. I highly recommend it for anyone seeking a truly luxurious and unforgettable getaway.",

At night, the entire bay lights up beautifully, creating an unforgettable atmosphere. The nightly light and water shows are truly a spectacle, adding to the area’s magical charm.\n\nMarina Bay Sands is also very tourist-friendly. Once you’ve walked around a bit or used the MRT nearby, getting your bearings becomes easy. The area feels safe, accessible, and full of energy.\n\nWe were incredibly lucky to visit while Singapore was preparing for its 60th National Day celebrations. We witnessed military rehearsals, fighter jets soaring overhead, and stunning fireworks lighting up the bay. Combined with the elegance of Marina Bay Sands, it made for a once-in-a-lifetime experience.\n\nHighly recommended for any visitor to Singapore.\n\nLet me know if you want to add hotel-specific feedback or highlight anything else like shopping, food, or the pool!",

        "review_text": "I had a very disappointing dining experience at the restaurant on the 55th floor of this supposedly “luxury” hotel.\n\nI was invited to dinner by a friend who was staying in one of the VIP suites. The restaurant is not open to the public and is exclusively for hotel guests, which made the experience feel even more exclusive—until the service completely ruined it.\n\nShortly after we began our meal, a staff member informed us that the dining time was limited to 90 minutes. That seemed fine at first. However, well before the 90 minutes were up, we were rushed by the same staff to finish our meal. I politely asked if we could have a little more time, as we were still eating slowly, and I noticed that two other tables who arrived before us were still enjoying their meals as well.\n\nEventually, they agreed to extend our time by 30 minutes and sent another staff member to apologize. I then asked again, “Isn’t the restaurant open until a certain time? Can guests eat until closing?” The person who came to apologize said, “Yes, you can stay and dine until the end.” So why was I being pushed out before our time was even up?\n\nWhat shocked me the most was the attitude of the first staff member—it felt cold and unwelcoming, as if we were not entitled to be there. Was it because we weren’t the registered guests, but just friends of a VIP guest? If so, that kind of discriminatory service is completely unacceptable in a hotel of this standard.\n\nThe environment and view were wonderful, but the service left a sour taste. Dining should be about hospitality and respect, and unfortunately, this experience had neither. I hope management takes this feedback seriously—this is not the level of service one expects a high-end establishment。",

From the moment I walked into the grand lobby, I could already feel that this was not just a hotel, but a world-class destination in itself. The scale, the design, and the atmosphere are breathtaking. Everything is built with such attention to detail that you immediately know you’re in one of the most iconic hotels in the world.\n\nThe highlight, of course, is the infinity pool at the SkyPark. I’ve seen it countless times in photos and videos, but being there in person is something else entirely. Swimming at the edge while overlooking the Singapore skyline is surreal—it feels like floating above the entire city. Day or night, the view is spectacular. In the morning, you get the calm and fresh energy of the city waking up, and at night, you’re treated to a dazzling skyline with lights that make the entire experience magical. It’s easily the most unforgettable pool I’ve ever been to.\n\nThe rooms are spacious, modern, and luxuriously comfortable. Floor-to-ceiling windows give you an unbeatable view, whether it’s the Gardens by the Bay or the city skyline. The beds are so comfortable that it’s almost difficult to get up in the morning—except you know you don’t want to waste any time staying in when you’re in such an amazing place. The bathroom amenities are top-notch, and everything feels meticulously maintained and spotless.\n\nDining at Marina Bay Sands is also an experience of its own. The selection of restaurants is phenomenal, from celebrity chef restaurants to local-inspired cuisine, ensuring there’s something for everyone. Every meal feels like part of the luxury experience, with flavors that are memorable and presentation that’s on point. The staff across all the restaurants are highly professional, attentive, and genuinely welcoming.\n\nWhat makes Marina Bay Sands stand out even more is the service. Every staff member I interacted with—from reception, concierge, housekeeping, to the restaurants—was friendly, helpful, and professional. They really go the extra mile to make guests feel taken care of, which is the hallmark of true 5-star hospitality.\n\nBeyond being a hotel, Marina Bay Sands is practically a city within a city. The integrated resort has luxury shopping, the ArtScience Museum, theaters, and direct access to Gardens by the Bay, making it incredibly convenient to explore. The location is unbeatable, with everything you need either within the resort or just a short walk away.\n\nOverall, Marina Bay Sands is not just a hotel stay—it’s an experience. It’s luxurious, iconic, and unforgettable in every sense. Whether you’re traveling for leisure, business, or a special occasion, this place leaves a lasting impression that you’ll treasure for a lifetime. If you want to experience the best of Singapore, there’s no better place than Marina Bay Sands. Absolutely worth every dollar, and I can’t wait to come back again.",

        "review_text": "A Review of the Sands Premier Suite at Marina Bay Sands\nIf you’re looking for a rejuvenating, luxurious holiday then you should definitely consider a stay at the prestigious Marina Bay Sands hotel!\nRecently, me and my family had an amazing experience staying in the Sands Premier Suite of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. From the moment we arrived at the hotel, the staff were very helpful and polite. They immediately helped us with our luggages which made me felt very welcome.\nThe entire hotel, from the ceiling to the walls are designed with lots of thoughts in mind. Because we arrived way earlier than the check-in time, they arranged a temporary key so we could enjoy the infinity pool while waiting. From the infinity pool, you could see the whole skyline of Singapore. The water temperature is just cool enough to make you feel relaxed but warm enough so that you won’t have a hard time getting out.\nAfter lunch, we came back to check-in and receive our room keys. They had 3 check-in counters, the “normal” one, the VIP one and the Paiza & Limosine one (which is like the Super VIP one). Because the “normal” check in counter was way too long, we got escorted to the Paiza & Limosine to check in. The receptionist there are very kind and quick, she got us our room in less than 5 minutes. Even though I booked the Sands Premier Studio, we got upgraded to the Sands Premier Suite (for free!).\nThe room was much bigger than a standard hotel room, with a separate living area that had a comfortable sofa and a large TV. The bedroom was also spacious and the bed was one of the most comfortable I’ve ever slept in. I really liked the floor-to-ceiling windows, which offered a stunning view of either the city skyline or the Gardens by the Bay. I chose the city view, and it was breathtaking, especially at night.\nThe bathroom was very modern and felt like a spa. It had a big bathtub for two people, which was a nice touch. They also provided very nice toiletries from Jo Malone. The room also had a walk-in wardrobe, which was very useful for keeping the room tidy and getting ready.\nIn conclusion, I would highly recommend the Sands Premier Suite. It’s a very luxurious option that offers excellent comfort, great amenities, and beautiful views. While it is quite expensive, the experience is worth it if you are looking for a special treat.",

        "review_text": "Marina Bay Sands Mall is truly a world-class shopping experience. From the moment you step in, the architecture grabs your attention  tall glass ceilings, polished marble floors, and a layout that blends elegance with ease. It feels more like walking through a luxury art gallery than a mall.\n\nThe range of shops is impressive from global designer labels like Louis Vuitton and Gucci to fine watch boutiques,handbags and jewelry stores. If you want to treat your self with luxury brands ,this is the place.\n\nOne of the best parts for me was the canal inside the mall, where you can take a gondola ride a lovely touch if you want something different. The waterfall feature in the middle adds to the charm.\n\nThe food options are diverse: from high end restaurants to casual bites and a food court downstairs with local and international cuisines.\n\nThe location is ideal too connected to Marina Bay Sands hotel, ArtScience Museum, and just a walk away from the Gardens by the Bay and the Spectra Light Show.",

We were given and upgrade as it was my birthday along and as we were just staying one night and had a late flight the next day we were offered a replacement keycard for the next day to access the facilities as well as a bookable shower room so we could freshen up before heading to the airport.\n\nThe room was not huge but was so comfortable and well appointed. The bathroom was gorgeous and everything felt fresh and brand new. The tech worked well including wireless charging on the night stands, auto opening curtains and the largest tv I have ever seen in a hotel room.\n\nWe had a great view of the city but immediately changed to try out the infinity pool which is better than I could have ever imagined. The staff are kind but some of the servers could do with a little more training as quite a few mistakes were made. Food and drinks came from nearby Wolfgang Puck Spago and even simple things such as a Caesar salad or burger were really excellent.\n\nIt is open 6am until midnight and we went three times to visit. Don’t forget the hot tubs on the other side of the pool deck.\n\nThe hotel itself is absolutely huge and has a large number of restaurants within it, also a massive shopping mall, nightclub and casino. It is a city within a city.\n\nIt is also close to Gardens on the Bay and a walkway goes through the hotel towards it. But you can’t access the walkway from the hotel and have to exit the hotel and take a small lift and then walk back into the hotel at walkway level. A small detail.\n\nThe location is not great for the city but there is a metro stop nearby and of course it is perfect for all the attractions around the Marina Bay. One day was not enough. I can’t wait to go back.",

Only black taxis( the expensive ones) were around and the valet and doormen were over whelmed. When I was leaving the cost for the black taxi to go to the airport was insane.\nOverall, the crowd put me off immediately to even consider staying at this hotel.\nThere are so many instructions on how to get around the hotel, and which lifts to use.\nI chose to have lunch at the foyer restaurant, as it's seafood buffet had been suggested to me. The restaurant is nice and the staff wonderful. The selection in the multi cuisine buffet stations is excellent, unfortunately with the exception of the seafood station. Prawns, lobster, crayfish, scallops arrive frozen from origin, then thawed and place on ice. All these were soggy, tasteless and chewy. I would avoid these.\nThe Sushi/Sashimi station is excellent.\nThe food in rest of the stations was also excellent.\nI visited the pool, which was again very crowded. I don't care how good a view a pool has, the crowd here was intolerable.\nThe top level restaurants and bars have a lovely view, so lunch or dinner would be a nice experience.",

The coordination by the staff was commendable. Although we initially faced a small issue with our ticket not scanning properly, the team handled it with genuine warmth and professionalism. They reassured us not to worry, quickly sorted out the problem, and welcomed us with a friendly smile, which really set the tone for a great experience.\n\nOnce we reached the top, the view was undeniably impressive—stretching across iconic landmarks like the Singapore Flyer, Gardens by the Bay, and the endless expanse of city and sea. Everything was immaculately maintained, from the observation deck to the common areas. Cleanliness and upkeep clearly seem to be a top priority here.\n\nThat said, there are a few areas where the experience could be elevated further. Tourists today look for more interactive and immersive elements. Simple additions—like informative or engaging video displays inside the lifts (similar to what Burj Khalifa offers)—can really enhance the journey upward. Even having touch-screen installations at the top showcasing the history or stories of the buildings in view could add value.\n\nAlso, visiting during the daytime can be quite uncomfortable due to the harsh sun and heat. Some shaded or misted zones, or even cooling stations, would allow visitors to enjoy their time without feeling the need to rush through it.\n\nOverall, Marina Bay Sands offers an iconic view, with a great team on the ground—but with just a few tweaks, it could offer a more memorable and comfortable experience for all.",

The room amenities are disappointing for a property of this level, making the stay far less comfortable than expected.\n\nThe pool area looks beautiful at first glance, but quickly becomes a letdown. There are no sunshades provided, the sunbeds are placed extremely close to each other with no sense of privacy, and once again the service around the pool is lacking.\n\nIn short, while Marina Bay Danza scores highly for design and atmosphere, it falls short in almost every other aspect that makes a stay in a 5 star hotel.",

Located on the waterfront of Marina Bay, the resort features an iconic design with three interconnected towers, topped by the Sands SkyPark, which boasts the world’s largest infinity pool. This rooftop area offers stunning panoramic views of Singapore’s skyline, creating a unique experience for hotel guests.\n\nThe resort offers 1,850 rooms and suites, ranging from elegant Premier Rooms to the ultra-luxurious Paiza Collection. The rooms are designed with modern sophistication, featuring plush furnishings, marble bathrooms, and the latest in-room technology. Guests staying in the Paiza Collection enjoy exclusive benefits, including butler service, private lounge access, and enhanced privileges at the SkyPark.\n\nMarina Bay Sands is also home to an impressive selection of dining options, with over 80 restaurants and bars. Renowned chefs like Wolfgang Puck, Gordon Ramsay, and Tetsuya Wakuda have established eateries here, offering a variety of world-class culinary experiences. The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands, an upscale shopping mall, features more than 300 luxury stores, while the ArtScience Museum offers an intriguing mix of exhibitions that combine art, science, and technology.\n\nEntertainment options at the resort are abundant. The light and water show, Spectra, is a nightly spectacle, and the MARQUEE nightclub adds to the vibrant nightlife scene. The casino, along with a theater hosting international performances and a large convention center, ensures that there’s always something to do. For those looking for relaxation, the Banyan Tree Spa provides a range of luxurious treatments, and the fitness center is equipped with state-of-the-art facilities.\n\nOne downside to consider is the resort’s sheer size, which can lead to crowded public areas, especially during peak seasons. Guests have occasionally mentioned longer wait times for certain amenities. Despite this, the vast array of services and the exceptional level of service offered at Marina Bay Sands often outweigh these inconveniences.\n\nMarina Bay Sands is a top-tier destination for travelers seeking a luxurious all-in-one resort experience. Whether you’re enjoying the infinity pool, dining at world-class restaurants, shopping, or indulging in the entertainment, the resort offers something for everyone, making it a standout choice when visiting Singapore.",

This law I did not see anywhere else in Singapore so the slow service does seem on purpose. Very crowded too.",

        "review_text": "Marina Bay Sands isn’t just a hotel—it's an icon that defines the Singapore skyline and an immersive experience in luxury, architecture, and entertainment. From the moment you enter, you're surrounded by a sense of scale and grandeur that few hotels in the world can match. The triple-tower structure, connected at the top by the SkyPark, feels futuristic yet harmoniously integrated with the Marina Bay waterfront.\n\nI stayed in a Premier Room on a high floor, and the view from the floor-to-ceiling windows was absolutely unforgettable—overlooking Gardens by the Bay and the Singapore Strait. The room itself was luxurious yet understated, with thoughtful design touches, a spacious bathroom with a rain shower, and everything you’d expect from a world-class 5-star property.\n\nOf course, the highlight was the infinity pool. It's reserved for hotel guests only and lives up to every bit of hype. Watching the city skyline glow at dusk while swimming 57 stories up was something I’ll remember forever. The SkyPark observation deck, accessible to the public for a fee, is also fantastic for views and photos.\n\nDining was equally stellar—LAVO had one of the best Italian meals I’ve had in Asia, and breakfast at Rise was generous, varied, and well-executed. The integrated shopping mall downstairs (The Shoppes) has everything from Louis Vuitton to artisanal coffee shops. You’ll also find the ArtScience Museum here, with its lotus-like design and rotating exhibitions.\n\nYes, it’s expensive. But for what you’re getting—the architecture, the views, the facilities, the sheer wow-factor—it’s one of those places worth splurging on at least once. Tip: Book early and request a higher floor with a pool-facing view",

A buffet breakfast was included, but oh my goodness, it was extremely busy no matter what time we attended. One day, there were over 70 people in the queue waiting to be seated. We sent an email to the hotel, as one day, our allocated table was next to a door for anyone to go outside into the garden dining area. This particular breakfast wasn't enjoyable as it was a constant thoroughfare with so many other guests squeezing past. We received a phone call within a few minutes of sending our email. They understood our issue but didn't offer any solution. We weren't offered this table again 🙏 The said table was still in place the following day! We also sadly noticed the huge amount of food being wasted from a lot of guests.\nWe had a couple of issues having to wait, one was for some wine we had ordered for our room, we eventually after almost an hour of waiting received a call to advise the wine wasn't available!\nThe room itself was lovely & the views were beautiful. Overall the staff were extremely polite & very helpful.\nThe main thoroughfare near to reception is extremely busy, with anyone being able to access not just guests staying at the hotel as the shopping mall/cinema/casino/restaurants, etc, are accessible from here.\nWe do hope the infrastructure is being carefully considered whilst Tower 4 is being constructed, as the number of people moving through & around is extremely busy!!\nThe infinity pool was amazing though & enjoyable 😎",

Love that these beautiful buildings can be seen at different vantage points around the city.\n\nWe visited three times, to the hotel and lobby bar. To tower three for a fine dining experience at Spago on L57 and to the shoppes for casual dining, shopping and the Sampan boat ride which is a must do.\n\nPro tip, book in advance at a restaurant or bar on L57 so you can enjoy the million dollar views, along with the establishments observation deck (which is) often private and for patrons only.\n\nSkypark observatory seems to have massive queues (and) for slightly more than you’d pay for the fee (you) can enjoy a beautiful experience instead.",

I got upgraded to a bayside suite room in Tower 3 in a newly renovated room and was able to watch the light show at the Gardens by the Bay which happens twice a night. The service was amazing and despite being such a big hotel, I did not feel lost or without attention. There is also a laser light show at the marina bay sands complex at night which was fun. Get there early to secure good seats. The area is fun to walk around or jog. There is also a mall attached and a casino. (Did not go so can’t comment)",

You’ll find friendly staff (we had an absolutely lovely woman checking us in!), and a ton of conveniences. What you won’t find is the hyper personal touch that a small, boutique hotel might offer. That said, you probably know that already considering the size and scope of this hotel.\n\nPerhaps, and as no surprise, the highlight is the Infinity Pool at the top. We went up in the morning, on a day with rain and clouds. We still enjoyed it. Though it was a bit cold for our comfort, we jumped between the infinity pool and a nearby jacuzzi. It was a fun and memorable experience.\n\nShopping nearby is plentiful, and the food options are many. We would love to stay longer the next time we visit.",

Other 5 star hotels in Singapore are much better in terms of cleanliness and interior, and service. Felt the rooms were not as modern and up to date for the price. Sheets and pillow smelled, and had stains even after requesting it to be changed. Didn’t feel comfortable and clean staying here. Expected much more as we were so excited to stay here.

The only issue is it would be crowded mostly and You can see a lot of guests clicking pictures and capturing the skyline. It gives one of the best views of the city and they have restaurants like Spago and Lavo right next to the pool which give quite a few and reasonable eating options as compared to the charges of the room.\n\nOverall I would say that the room sizes could be better at the cost that is charged but then again you should be prepared for spending some money if you want to visit and stay in one of the most expensive hotels in one of the most expensive city 😜.

The room seemed to rely on the spectacular view as a selling point but the furnishings were cheap looking and in some places damaged. Room amenities vere very basic. The in room dining was a little disappointing. It kind of reminds me of a Disney resort hotel without the characters or excellent service. The restaurant we tried inside the hotel wasn't great although the views again were spectacular. Fortunately you have direct access to the shops in the mall and some really great places to eat. There are also loads of high end stores so if shopping is your thing that will definitely help. The infinity pool/sky-park were very nice but definitely not worth staying there for. The complex is connected to Gardens by the Bay which is an awesome attraction. The garden is accessible from many downtown hotels though so again not sure it's worth staying here for. One tip for this place is that it is HUGE. Give yourself some extra time if you are going anywhere that is not in the tower you are staying in. We had a nice stay but the hotel itself was just average.",

If you can afford to stay it’s a great one I believe, I couldn’t afford so we went in for the deck tour to get the superior view of Singapore from top. Guess it was more than 54 floor and deck is on top floor and went in by a high speed elevator, was not crowded when we went, the cost covers a digital photo and if you need a printed one it’s extra. The view from the deck is stunning and luckily when we went it was not that sunny, so could enjoy the view. The swimming pool is on other side and only residents are allowed and from the deck we can catch a glimpse. Please experience this view if you are in Singapore. Once we were done and got to the reception level we strolled the huge lobby which was decorated well for Christmas and had some snacks at the cafe /bakery there. Taste was awesome and you must try. From the entrance of the hotel where taxi dropped us for the deck tour the gardens by the bay is walkable which is another attraction you should not miss.",

The roof top breakfast at Spago was excellent and the breeze coming in was cooling which is surprising given it's Singapore!\n\nMinor area for improvement: The check in process left much to be desired as the app to check-in that was meant to streamline the check in process ended up being extremely inefficient.\n\nOther than that, the views from the room were fantastic, we were on the 34th floor. We were able to watch the sunrise from the comfort of our room.",

I saw many reviews saying that there are many more people that didn’t get their deposit back either . When we called in , they just told us to wait and they will check for us and all but nothing was done and our deposit isn’t back after 2 weeks",

However, the service at the lobby and concierge is excellent.\n\nA few years ago, the hotel underwent a major renovation, and the rooms have been updated to a higher standard, which I’m really happy with. Since COVID, hotel prices in Singapore have risen across the board, and Marina Bay Sands is no exception. It’s now hard to find a room for under $700 a night.\n\nStill, the signature infinity pool is something you just can’t miss :) I often bring guests here, and the growing number of F&B outlets offers a variety of options, which is very satisfying.",

Maybe 3 reception stations were open with about 2-3 employees at each one. It felt like an airport check in.\n\nAfter standing in line for around 10minutes we were told to go to a back room to check in. The lady who checked us in was incredibly unfriendly. If she smiled it would have cracked her face.\n\nRoom was very nice but small. View was great until you looked down to the ground and they were doing construction. They don’t tell you this when you check in to a room with the garden view.\n\nWe were told our bags would arrive within 15-20min after checking in. After 30min I called front desk and I was told they were on the way up. 30min after that call luggage never arrived. I then called again and told them I was coming down to reception to collect the bags.\n\nThey once again told me the bags are on the way up. 10min later the bags arrived.\n\nWe headed up to the observation deck and it was like stepping foot into a disaster camp. As soon as you exit the elevator staff with cameras try and con you to take photos for money. This was really irritating and they blocked the entire walk way to the outer deck.\n\nYou had people sleeping all over the chairs and deck floor. There was even people having picnics with food out on the deck. So tacky.\n\nWent and asked for information at the desk and again a stone cold faced women barely spoke to us.\n\nFor the price they charge and the service they provide it is not worth it. Staff are rude and the place is like an airport terminal.",

Be there 15 mins before the ticket time to ensure a smooth experience. Also, if there is bad weather, you wouldn’t be allowed to go to the top floor, but would be refunded or choose an another day as per your choice.",

        "review_text": "Marina Bay Sands is one of those places you have to experience at least once in Singapore — it’s more than just a hotel, it’s an icon. The views from the rooftop are legendary, but here’s the insider tip: instead of paying for a full-day pass, make a reservation at one of the rooftop bars or restaurants. That way, you get the same incredible skyline without overspending. Sometimes staff will let you walk around after dining, but it’s not guaranteed — so booking a drink or meal is the safest bet.\n\nThe food here is truly exceptional. From high-end restaurants to casual bites, everything feels curated, and you don’t have to break the bank if you plan wisely. Downstairs, the Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands mall is stunning — a mix of luxury brands, unique boutiques, and even a canal with gondola rides. Don’t miss the wine and whisky collection store; it’s like walking into a museum of rare bottles.\n\nAt night, the free Spectra light and water show at 8:00 and 9:00 PM outside the mall is a must-see — a dazzling blend of fountains, lasers, and music against the backdrop of the bay. Inside the hotel, the architecture itself is an experience: the world’s largest rooftop infinity pool (hotel guests only), soaring lobbies, and restaurants that rival any luxury destination.\n\nFun facts:\n• Marina Bay Sands opened in 2010 and cost around $5.5 billion USD to build.\n• The rooftop SkyPark spans all three towers and could fit four and a half A380 planes end to end.\n• The infinity pool is the longest elevated pool in the world at 150m.\n\nTip: Book a restaurant in advance for sunset, explore the mall before or after, and stay for the evening light show. It’s one of the few luxury experiences where you control how much you spend — and it’s worth every minute.",

We only stayed there for 1 night as it's quite expensive & I'm usually quite a budget conscious person, so I don't usually stay at 5 star hotels, but the MBS hotel service is second to none. After getting there, we were immediately offered assistance with our luggage by staff, which was brought upstairs for us. The check in & check out process is seamless & straight-forward.\nI'm not a gambler, so I didn't go to the casino, but I do like to keep my fitness up whilst I'm away, so I do recommend their gym. It is a fair walk from the rooms, but the variety of equipment was fantastic & it's a 24 hour gym too.\nObviously, you also can't go past the Infinity Pool whilst you're at MBS. Just remember to take your hotel key card with you when you go up.\nOverall, despite the high price tag, I do recommend MBS if you do stay in Singapore, even if it's just for 1 night.",

We were warmly greeted by the hotel staffs upon arrival, and a heartfelt compliment goes to Tiffany Tan who was the concierge staff that attended to us and settled our check-in. We were pleasantly surprised when Tiffany had offered a room upgrade to celebrate the occasion if we don’t mind waiting a bit longer to get the room ready. Whilst waiting she offered temporary guest cards so they have access to the observation deck and pool which was much nicer than waiting at the lobby. On top of that, we also found a delicious chocolate cake in the room! My parents were beyond delighted by this sweet gesture, and I can’t thank Tiffany enough for being so attentive in making this absolutely memorable for them. The room was of course immaculate, the view stunning and the experience exceeded expectations. They enjoyed their stay and will definitely be back! Thank you once again to the amazing team at MBS.",

Symbiosis with the Ocean**\n- **Boundless Vistas**: Perched atop a crescent-shaped bay, every suite features 270-degree floor-to-ceiling windows. The tides become a living mural, while the \"Golden Hour of the Sea\" during dawn and dusk offers a private visual feast.\n- **Exclusive Shoreline**: A private 800-meter white sand beach pairs with a tidal monitoring system that alerts guests to optimal tide-pooling times. Guided explorations reveal hidden intertidal ecosystems at low tide.\n\n**2. Architectural Poetry**\n- **Cultural Reverence**: Inspired by traditional fishing village dwellings, the terraced structure boasts a façade embedded with millions of recycled seashells, their undulating textures shimmering like sunlit waves.\n- **Liquid Aesthetics**: The lobby dazzles with 3,000 hand-blown glass jellyfish lamps. Ocean breezes animate the space, casting rippling shadows that transform check-in into an aquatic overture.\n\n**3. Sensory Sanctuary**\n- **Smart Ambiance**: Beds auto-adjust to body contours, while voice-controlled systems cycle through soundscapes like \"coral reef white noise\" or \"dolphin frequency.\" Mineral-seaweed aromas diffuse via circadian-rhythm scent systems.\n- **Marine Interaction**: Balconies house underwater periscopes; UV night mode unveils bioluminescent plankton. A cabin journal logs daily sightings of rare marine species.\n\n**4. Reimagined Ocean Experiences**\n- **Tidal Gastronomy**: A 18-course \"Marine Evolution\" tasting menu evolves with daily catches. Glass-floored dining platforms frame schools of fish darting beneath diners’ feet.\n- **Abyssal Meditation**: Collaborating with oceanographers, transparent submersible pods host singing bowl sessions at 20-meter depths, where humpback whale songs resonate through the hull.\n\n**5. Sustainable Innovation**\n- Tidal energy meets 60% of power needs; greywater nourishes vertical algae walls that filter CO₂.\n- The \"Coral Adoption Program\" lets guests plant reefs for carbon credits, redeemable for eco-experiences like nocturnal squid tagging.\n\nMore than a hotel, it’s a portal to marine consciousness—when bare feet touch moon-warmed sands and smart tidal bracelets pulse to signal a bioluminescent bloom, worldly identities dissolve with the receding tide, leaving only the true self in whispered dialogue with the eternal sea.",

A highlight was the view from our room, which looked out on the Gardens By the Bay so we were able to watch the nightly light show from our balcony. The hotel is also in a great location, very close to lots of shops and restaurants. Oh, and I guess there is a nice infinity pool on the roof, but you probably already know about that. 🙂",

We started by strolling through the luxurious mall, where they enjoyed browsing the wide range of shops. The atmosphere was vibrant, and the architecture itself was impressive, adding to the overall experience.\n\nAfter exploring the mall, we took a leisurely walk through the surrounding areas, which offered stunning views of the city skyline. The walk across to Gardens by the Bay was particularly enjoyable, as it provided a perfect blend of modernity and nature. Our friends were captivated by the seamless transition from the bustling mall to the serene gardens. Marina Bay Sands is a must-visit for anyone looking to experience the best of what Singapore has to offer!",

Plus, in case you didn't know this already, you can actually walk on top of this mall!  There is an elevator to the top, and the view from here is amazing!  Not only that, but you can also walk directly to the Supertree Forest, via a special walkway which they have built between the two locations, saving you all kinds of time.

The service is exemplary, with staff going above and beyond to ensure a seamless stay.\n\nThe highlight of Marina Bay Sands is undoubtedly the Infinity Pool on the SkyPark, which is the world’s largest rooftop pool. Floating on the edge of the pool while gazing at the cityscape is an unforgettable experience. The SkyPark also houses observation decks and restaurants offering gourmet dining, further elevating the luxury quotient.\n\nFor entertainment, Marina Bay Sands has something for everyone. The integrated resort includes a high-end shopping mall, an impressive casino, and the ArtScience Museum, which hosts cutting-edge exhibitions. The theater regularly features international performances, adding to the cultural allure.\n\nWhile the experience is undoubtedly luxurious, it comes with a premium price tag.

From the moment I set foot in this iconic hotel, I was spellbound by the sheer beauty of the bay area and the rich cultural experiences that surrounded me.\n\nThe first thing that left me in awe was the breathtaking view of the city skyline from the rooftop infinity pool. The sight of the glittering skyscrapers and the stunning Marina Bay was nothing short of magical, especially during the evening when the city lights up. I could have spent hours just soaking in this incredible panorama.\n\nThe Bay Area itself is a sight to behold. The calm waters of the bay, juxtaposed with the bustling cityscape, create a unique and captivating atmosphere. A leisurely stroll along the bay promenade allowed me to absorb the vibrant energy of this place and appreciate the blend of modernity and tradition that Singapore so perfectly encapsulates.\n\nOverall, my visit to Marina Bay Sands in Singapore was nothing short of extraordinary. The hotel, the bay area, and the cultural experiences exceeded my expectations and made my first trip to Singapore a memorable one. If you're seeking a blend of luxury, culture, and breathtaking views, this is the place to be. I left with a heavy heart, but with memories I will cherish for a lifetime.",

From the moment I arrived, I was thoroughly impressed by the level of service and attention to detail that the resort provided.\n\nOne of the highlights of my stay was the unexpected room upgrade I received, which afforded me breathtaking views of the Singapore skyline and Marina Bay. Being able to wake up and enjoy the stunning vistas each morning was truly a treat. Swimming in the infinity pool was an experience I'll never forget.\n\nWhat really sets Marina Bay Sands apart, though, was the exceptional level of service. The resort provided me with temporary cards that allowed me to access the swimming pool and reserve time slots for the shower facilities, even after I had checked out. This thoughtful touch ensured that I could continue to enjoy the resort's amenities on my final day, without any hassle.\n\nI cannot recommend Marina Bay Sands highly enough. Whether you're visiting Singapore for business or leisure, this iconic resort offers an unparalleled blend of luxury, service, and unforgettable experiences. I left feeling refreshed, rejuvenated.",

The complex consists of three towering hotel blocks connected at the top by the SkyPark, an engineering marvel that offers panoramic views of the city skyline and Marina Bay.\n\nOne of the biggest draws is the world-famous infinity pool, located on the rooftop. Reserved exclusively for hotel guests, the pool provides an unforgettable experience—floating above the city while enjoying spectacular views. Many visitors book at least one night’s stay just to access it, and while prices can be high, booking during off-peak periods or through special promotions can help you save significantly.\n\nBeyond the pool, the resort is home to a large shopping mall, a casino, and a wide variety of dining options ranging from food court fare to high-end restaurants by celebrity chefs. The quality of food across the property is consistently excellent.\n\nWhat makes Marina Bay Sands truly special is its dual perspective: you can enjoy stunning views of both the futuristic Gardens by the Bay and the dazzling city skyline, especially at night when the lights come alive.\n\nWhether you’re staying overnight, dining, or just visiting the observation deck, it’s an experience that’s absolutely worth having at least once in your lifetime.",

All is great here . . . 😊 😲\n\n. . . but Wait Wait, guess something is amiss. . . any place to order a quick coffee with sit down option (yes ORIGIN BLOOM is there, but the seating is only available on Level 3, the one at Level 1 just has taken away options). For the first time visitors, head to Food Court in basement level and hopefully you should find a place to sit + sip your ☕ KOPI 😉",

During my recent visit, I attended the STACK Conference organized by GovTech, held in its expansive event spaces. The venue is impressively large, with state-of-the-art facilities that can accommodate conferences and workshops seamlessly. I organized a workshop for 40 participants, and the spacious, well-equipped room made the experience smooth and productive.\n\nBeyond the corporate side, Marina Bay Sands also doubles as a shopping haven, with a sprawling mall featuring high-end brands, fine dining, and entertainment options. It's an exceptional venue that effortlessly blends business with leisure, offering something for everyone.",

Room was big and clean, however, it looked a bit tired with nicks and scratches on the furnishings! I expected being that it is a highly praised and visible hotel that everything would be on the luxurious side, but I have seen better. On the brighter side, the hotel is centrally located with all the highlights of what Singapore has to offer within walking distance. The hotel also boasts a high-end mall with food court. It does get extremely busy so plan accordingly if you'd like to get something to eat and to see any light shows, need to show up at least an hour before to get prime spot. Any the infinity pool was amazing overlooking the city! We went at 6 am in the morning for a swim and no one was around until about 6:30 am then the crowd started to build up. All in all, it was an amazing stay and would still recommend the hotel!",

        "review_text": "Marina Bay Sands is one of Singapore’s most iconic landmarks, a luxury hotel that is more than just a place to stay—it’s an experience in itself. During my recent visit, I was left in awe of its architectural grandeur, world-class amenities, and stunning views. Adding to this, my dining experience at LAVO Italian Restaurant & Rooftop Bar was a highlight of the trip, though there were some areas where it could have been better.\n\n**Marina Bay Sands Experience:**\n\nFrom the moment you arrive at Marina Bay Sands, the sheer scale of the place is impressive. The hotel consists of three massive towers connected by a SkyPark, which offers one of the best panoramic views of the city. Checking in was seamless despite the large number of guests, and the staff were attentive and professional throughout our stay.\n\nThe rooms were spacious, well-appointed, and offered floor-to-ceiling windows with breathtaking views of Singapore’s skyline or the bay. The attention to detail in the rooms, from the plush bedding to the luxurious bathrooms, made our stay incredibly comfortable. The location of Marina Bay Sands is also unbeatable—it’s situated near many of Singapore’s key attractions, such as Gardens by the Bay, the ArtScience Museum, and the Merlion, making it perfect for tourists looking to explore the city.\n\nHowever, what sets Marina Bay Sands apart is its world-famous infinity pool located on the 57th floor. Floating in the pool while taking in the views of the city skyline is an experience you won’t forget. It’s worth noting that the pool area does get crowded, especially during peak hours, so it’s best to visit early in the morning or late in the evening for a more relaxed atmosphere.\n\nFor entertainment, Marina Bay Sands also boasts a world-class casino, high-end shopping at The Shoppes, and an array of restaurants, bars, and cafes. The hotel’s wide variety of dining options ensures there’s something for everyone, from casual eateries to fine dining.\n\n**Dining at LAVO Restaurant:**\n\nOne of the dining highlights at Marina Bay Sands was our dinner at LAVO Italian Restaurant & Rooftop Bar. Situated on the 57th floor, LAVO offers stunning 360-degree views of Singapore’s skyline, and the ambiance is unbeatable. The warm lighting, plush seating, and open-air terrace create a sophisticated yet relaxed atmosphere. Whether you’re seated indoors or outdoors, you’re in for a visual treat.\n\nLAVO’s menu is an impressive mix of Italian-American cuisine. We started with the *Fried Calamari* and *Meatball*, both of which were delicious. The calamari was perfectly crisp, and the meatball was tender and flavorful, served in a rich tomato sauce. For our main course, we ordered the *Spaghetti Carbonara* and *Lobster Ravioli*. The carbonara was creamy and flavorful, though slightly on the heavier side, while the lobster ravioli was a standout dish, with perfectly cooked pasta and generous portions of lobster.\n\nHowever, as much as we enjoyed the food, the prices were on the higher side, which is to be expected given the prime location. The service, while friendly, could have been more attentive. It took longer than expected for our orders to be taken, and the food arrived slightly later than anticipated. While the ambiance and views made up for the slight delays, it’s something that could be improved for a more seamless dining experience.\n\nThe rooftop bar at LAVO is a must-visit for anyone looking to enjoy cocktails with a view. The drinks were well-crafted, and sipping a cocktail while watching the city lights come to life was a memorable experience.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nMarina Bay Sands is a premier destination in Singapore, offering a luxurious stay with unparalleled views, world-class amenities, and a range of dining options. The infinity pool alone makes it worth the visit, and its location is perfect for exploring Singapore. LAVO Restaurant, with its stunning views and delicious Italian-American cuisine, is a great dining spot, though a few tweaks in service would make it even better. Overall, both the hotel and restaurant was amazing.",

The diverse dining options and vibrant atmosphere in the hotel added to the overall charm. Marina Bay Sands exceeded my expectations, offering a perfect blend of opulence and comfort for an indulgent getaway.",

The only reason that I'm giving it 3 stars is really because we went up to a restaurant at the top of hotel on the platform. The SGN 30 per ticket is redeemable on for and drink. It was fine, in terms of the food and drinks on offer, but it was overcrowded and the staff, salary, didn't really offer a great service. So in some ways, I wish we'd just paid to be on the actual viewing deck. It's a thing to do, but it's a coin toss whether to dine or do just the viewing deck",

Do not attempt online checkin, because then your stuff won’t reach your room from the drop-off and there will be issues with the online deposit. This simply does not work as you would expect. The room is quite nice on higher floors, but they started some maintenance next to our room and as they left an emergency exit open and blocked the beeping noise was quite disturbing in our room during the night. We were offered a new room, but as we would had to move our staff the night before our checkout, it did not make any sense. We would have expected much more from such a high ranked hotel and considering these it does not worth the money. Maybe one time to check the pool. I never had to call or contact the front desk so often in any other hotel like here, and we are not picky at all. The service is nice and the staff is polite but not flexible at all.

We've been waiting 15 minutes in line to get a table for breakfast, no one had time to serve us at breakfast, and the food was not very good, we waited in line to check in, we waited in line to check out, the restaurant makes mistakes on the order at lunch. The check out-person told us we could keep our access to the first room while waiting for the suite to get ready, but our key cards stopped working so we had to spend another 30-40 minutes with the check in counter to get access to our luggage which was still in the old room. Finally, after spending $1,200 for a night in their suite we were asked to walk to an ATM to withdraw $2 for stamps so they could send two postcards for us. OK, thanks\n\nIt is evident that the service as a Premier Room customer is low. The service level as a Suite customer is much higher - use Club 55 as much as possible! The service at Club 55 lives up to our expectations and service at other great hotels and Club 55 together with the pool is what gives this hotel 3 out of 5 stars. This was a nice change after the first day. We have stayed at 7 hotels in the past 30 days, and even though the service level increased a lot after booking the suite, this hotel comes in at rank 6 out of 7 hotels (second last).\n\nThe top floor pool is amazing, though.

It's a popular tourist spot and for very good reason. Just be ready to have money on you or look like you have money with you when you're there, because the products there are going to be relatively expensive, but I believe it'll be worth it. The experience is definitely one you cannot miss when in Singapore",

The luggage magically came to the room and left the room without us needing to supervise, thanks to the very able luggage staff and the exceptional operational management. It is worth staying in the suites for this premiere experience. Each dining option offered by the hotel is just fabulous, with the stunning views from Club 55, the beautifully crafted cakes and savouries at Renku, and especially the widespread and delicious breakfast selections at Rise. The ease with which the scale of operation at breakfast at Rise is managed is just remarkable. The swimming pool experience was also memorable, and we managed to go at times when the crowds were a little less. The suite itself was beautifully appointed, with all necessities placed in the correct position. The views were stunning..we were lucky to get a corner room for an Orchid suite, which offered both city and garden views with sunset and sunrise views. The large windows with mechanised curtains truly elevate the experience. The bathroom and all its amenities, including the selection of toiletries, was extremely premiere. And it is extremely easy to access the towers, the mall, and the various dining places due to the logical layout of the whole complex. The only thing thing that needs a bit of improvement is the elevator waiting time when exiting the sky deck. Overall, amazing stay and we will come back.",

        "review_text": "The food court service and food standard at MBS managed by Koufu is worse than a hawker centre. Rasapura Masters is the name of this food court at MBS which is managed by the Koufu. This is not the first time we patronize this place and the latest incident really makes me feel pissed off and decided to leave a bad review for them. Firstly, we bought coffee and tea from them, the taste is so bland and diluted. Therefore i return back to the beverage counter asking for more condensed milk to be added. But to my surprise instead of condensed milk sugar was added instead? Is this the correct way to brew and serve a cup of coffee/tea which cost $2.20 to the customer and give substandard quality? We don't mind to pay extra but it is really not worth as hawker centre coffee is even better than them! And the food court executive is standing at the beverage order counter allowing all this to happen? Secondly, we bought ice kacang from the dessert counter and the portion and appearance is totally different from what is display on the signage. I feel cheated as this is not way to do business and it costs $4.30 for this kind of dessert? I approach the staff making the dessert and she rudely told me is like that one, the display is only a photo! Come on shouldn't you make the finished product to be almost the same as display or else this is actually considered as cheating customers. Example if i sell fishball noodles, my signage display is three fishball and some fishcake but the end product i cook out i only put one fishball into the noodles. Is it correct to do so? I don't think so! This foodcourt is simply a disgrace to the customers especially to the tourists and ruined Singapore food and beverages heritage which they represented at MBS...",

Thank you! worth the stay! The staff is very friendly and nice. I ask for a match after 5 mins they delivered it. I like the place because it's just adjacent to the Mall and to the food court which has a cheaper food price. The infinity pool is amazing friendly staff. There is one time I forgot my wallet in the room and we were hungry at the infinity pool we ordered our food and they just charge my room no. and when we check out they just automatically deduct it to our deposit. Perfect place for a proposal facing the garden bay and the flower dome. Thank you, Marina Bay Sands, for the great experience! I will surely visit again and most important the casino was huge and amazing",

We were able to navigate the city easily and get to and from the airport.\n\nCheck-in was smooth, we were lucky that our room was available ahead of standard check-in times. After a 13hr flight into Singapore that was great news!!\n\nRoof Top Infinity Pool - Of course the is a must see! Recommend going at sunset.\n\nRISE - food was good; service was ok.\n\nOrigin + Bloom - food & coffee were good. Recommend the smoked salmon breakfast sandwich!",

The unique architecture and beautiful design greeted us en route from the airport.\n\nArriving at the property we witnessed an air traffic control level of coordination across 5 drive through lanes.\n\nWe were greeted by multiple bag handlers and brought into the lobby for check-in.\nWhile waiting a brief 15 minutes, a member of reception walked the queue and offered bottled water. There must have been 20 different receptionists checking guests in.\n\nAfter getting checked in we went up to our room on the 9th floor, room 93 facing the Gardens by the Bay. The room was as luxurious as you would imagine for the price paid. All the amenities you could think of from coffee/tea, a variety of premade alcohol cocktails, snacks and meals, stocked mini fridge, complimentary candies, and all the appropriate drinkware.\n\nThe bathroom offered a tub for two, double vanity's, fully stocked Salvatore Ferragamo soaps, shampoo, conditioner, body lotion. Additionally, the vanity drawer was stocked with nail kits, dental kits, hair brush and comb. There was a walk-in shower with a rain forest shower or an angled shower head and a frosted glass door. Right next to it was a motion sensing toilet bidet with a full multifunction control panel and frosted glass door.\n\nThe beds were two plush queen sized mattresses and for entertainment and various information availability was a 90 inch TV screen on the wall directly in front of the beds.\n\nThe last piece was a walk out balcony with two chairs and a table. The views to the Gardens by the Bay and the overall harbor were incredible and definitely worth the upgrade.\n\nIf you have the means I would encourage staying here every time in Singapore if not, book it at least once for a night or two to gain access to the 57th floor rooftop infinity pool. Or you can enjoy one of the many fine dining options.",

This magnificent hotel and entertainment complex is an ambitious project that has set a new standard for hospitality and entertainment in Southeast Asia.\n\nOne of the most impressive aspects of Marina Bay Sands is the ambition behind the project.

They take pride in their work, and it shows in their attention to detail and the high level of service they provide.\n\nOne of the things that impressed me most about the staff at Marina Bay Sands is the way they explain the various features and amenities of the complex. From the moment you check in, you are given a comprehensive overview of everything the complex has to offer, including information on the various dining options, entertainment venues, and shopping experiences. The staff takes the time to answer any questions you may have, and they do so in a friendly and informative manner.\n\nOverall, Marina Bay Sands is an impressive complex that is well worth a visit.

Check-in was smooth and efficient — we received a temporary room card that already gave us access to the pool, which was very convenient. We decided to do some shopping first, and when we returned to collect our official room cards, we were pleasantly surprised to learn that we had been given an upgrade. This gesture was truly appreciated.\n\nAs always, the pool and the food were excellent. You have the option to enjoy breakfast either by the pool or downstairs. If you're looking for a large buffet and don’t mind a lively atmosphere, the downstairs option is ideal. However, if you prefer a quieter, more refined experience with a set menu, the poolside breakfast is the better choice.\n\nWe thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would be happy to return again in the future.",

The scale of their work is extraordinary—cleaning massive, high-tech rooms with meticulous precision, restocking coolers and amenities, and ensuring no detail is overlooked, all within tight time frames. As someone with severe OCD, I notice everything, and I was genuinely in awe.\n\nOne housekeeper, in particular, came to refill my ice bucket—something I didn’t even need—yet she bowed repeatedly and apologized as though she were inconveniencing me. Her humility and dedication were deeply touching. Later, another staff member surprised me with a vegan birthday cake, complete with a candle. I had forgotten it was even my birthday, but that thoughtful gesture nearly brought me to tears. It wasn’t just a dessert; it was a reminder that I was seen and valued.\n\nIn a hotel renowned for grandeur, it’s the quiet diligence of the housekeeping team that, in my view, forms the true backbone of Marina Bay Sands. They made me feel special, cared for, and genuinely welcome. I would return not just for the stunning rooms, but to personally thank and see these remarkable individuals again.\n\nThank you so much for this experience, it made my birthday trip.",

It was one of those moments that just takes your breath away. Everything felt magical.

I booked two suites for our family, kids, and nieces so everyone could be part of the celebration.\n\nThe rooms and the pool were simply amazing, and the kids had the time of their lives. But what truly stood out was the exceptional service, especially from Erica, who gave us a check-in experience unlike anything I’ve had before.\n\nWe were greeted right at the car and taken directly to our suite, where the kids were welcomed with chocolates and apples. While the little ones ran around, excited and full of joy, my family and I completed the check-in formalities in the comfort of our room — no queues, no waiting, just pure ease.\n\nFrom start to finish, everything about our stay was thoughtful, seamless, and special. Thank you, Marina Bay Sands, for making my son’s birthday a memory we will cherish forever.",

Even just strolling along the promenade was relaxing and memorable.\nWhat made the week truly unforgettable was having dinner at the rooftop, making TikTok, right at the highest point of the building. The view was absolutely breathtaking, same time watched the sunset paint the sky in warm colours followed by a full moon rising above the sky line Everything felt way magical. The atmosphere and the sky views together perfectly not for only us. Highly recommended and don’t miss the chance if you’re planning to visit 🇸🇬.\nSee you soon",

However, the service at the lobby and concierge is excellent.\n\nA few years ago, the hotel underwent a major renovation, and the rooms have been updated to a higher standard, which I’m really happy with. Since COVID, hotel prices in Singapore have risen across the board, and Marina Bay Sands is no exception. It’s now hard to find a room for under $700 a night.\n\nStill, the signature infinity pool is something you just can’t miss :) I often bring guests here, and the growing number of F&B outlets offers a variety of options, which is very satisfying.",

        "review_text": "1. The Landscape – Clean, Refined, and Aesthetically Pleasing\n\nWhat struck me most upon arriving in Singapore was how neatly orchestrated everything felt — as if every corner had been thoughtfully composed. The city is meticulously planned yet still breathes with nature. Green spaces are not just “added in,” they’re woven into the very fabric of the urban environment — from vast parks to rooftop gardens and tree-lined streets.\n\nEach district has its own flavor: Marina Bay is sleek and futuristic, Arab Street is a burst of color and culture, while Gardens by the Bay feels like stepping into a dream where technology and nature intertwine.\n\n2. Singapore at Night – Where the City Truly Shines\n\nIf Singapore in the daytime is a pristine canvas, then nighttime turns it into a masterpiece. As the sun sets, the city transforms — illuminated by thousands of lights that reflect off glass towers and gentle waterways.\n\nKey landmarks like Marina Bay Sands, Clarke Quay, Helix Bridge, and the lotus-shaped ArtScience Museum light up in ways that feel almost cinematic. Walking along the Singapore River at night, you can’t help but slow down — not from tiredness, but from awe. The “Spectra” light and water show at Marina Bay isn’t just a spectacle — it’s a moment that stays with you.\n\n3. The Rhythm of Life – Energetic, Yet Graceful\n\nDespite being a hub of finance, tech, and tourism, Singapore doesn’t feel overwhelming. People move quickly, but not anxiously. The city runs with purpose but still feels respectful, clean, and kind.\n\nThere’s a deep sense of order and mindfulness in how locals interact with public spaces — how they queue, how they keep the streets spotless, how they balance modern life with cultural roots. It's a quiet discipline that leaves a lasting impression.",

Maybe 3 reception stations were open with about 2-3 employees at each one. It felt like an airport check in.\n\nAfter standing in line for around 10minutes we were told to go to a back room to check in. The lady who checked us in was incredibly unfriendly. If she smiled it would have cracked her face.\n\nRoom was very nice but small. View was great until you looked down to the ground and they were doing construction. They don’t tell you this when you check in to a room with the garden view.\n\nWe were told our bags would arrive within 15-20min after checking in. After 30min I called front desk and I was told they were on the way up. 30min after that call luggage never arrived. I then called again and told them I was coming down to reception to collect the bags.\n\nThey once again told me the bags are on the way up. 10min later the bags arrived.\n\nWe headed up to the observation deck and it was like stepping foot into a disaster camp. As soon as you exit the elevator staff with cameras try and con you to take photos for money. This was really irritating and they blocked the entire walk way to the outer deck.\n\nYou had people sleeping all over the chairs and deck floor. There was even people having picnics with food out on the deck. So tacky.\n\nWent and asked for information at the desk and again a stone cold faced women barely spoke to us.\n\nFor the price they charge and the service they provide it is not worth it.

Felt claustrophobic inside. One of the TVs was not working. The hotel is also very crowded and filled with rude Chinese tourists (not hotels fault).  The infinity pool on the roof was packed and dirty. The service was exceptional though but unfortunately it did not make up for the hotels shortcomings. Disappointed by the overall experience and will not stay here again in the future. The Singapore Edition was a better experience and I recommend people to try that instead of this.",

The area is meticulously managed, ensuring flawless cleanliness, safety, and organization, rendering it perfect for leisurely strolls or romantic evenings. Notable attractions include the Marina Bay Sands SkyPark, which offers panoramic views, the Spectra Light & Water Show, and the Gardens by the Bay, particularly the Supertree Grove. The surrounding area also boasts outstanding dining options, ranging from street food to fine dining with remarkable views. The hotel's architectural design, especially the infinity pool, is genuinely impressive and breathtaking!😊",

        "review_text": "I had a very disappointing dining experience at the restaurant on the 55th floor of this supposedly “luxury” hotel.\n\nI was invited to dinner by a friend who was staying in one of the VIP suites. The restaurant is not open to the public and is exclusively for hotel guests, which made the experience feel even more exclusive—until the service completely ruined it.\n\nShortly after we began our meal, a staff member informed us that the dining time was limited to 90 minutes. That seemed fine at first. However, well before the 90 minutes were up, we were rushed by the same staff to finish our meal. I politely asked if we could have a little more time, as we were still eating slowly, and I noticed that two other tables who arrived before us were still enjoying their meals as well.\n\nEventually, they agreed to extend our time by 30 minutes and sent another staff member to apologize. I then asked again, “Isn’t the restaurant open until a certain time? Can guests eat until closing?” The person who came to apologize said, “Yes, you can stay and dine until the end.” So why was I being pushed out before our time was even up?\n\nWhat shocked me the most was the attitude of the first staff member—it felt cold and unwelcoming, as if we were not entitled to be there. Was it because we weren’t the registered guests, but just friends of a VIP guest? If so, that kind of discriminatory service is completely unacceptable in a hotel of this standard.\n\nThe environment and view were wonderful, but the service left a sour taste. Dining should be about hospitality and respect, and unfortunately, this experience had neither. I hope management takes this feedback seriously—this is not the level of service one expects a high-end establishment。",

        "review_text": "Marina Bay Sands is one of those places you have to experience at least once in Singapore — it’s more than just a hotel, it’s an icon. The views from the rooftop are legendary, but here’s the insider tip: instead of paying for a full-day pass, make a reservation at one of the rooftop bars or restaurants. That way, you get the same incredible skyline without overspending. Sometimes staff will let you walk around after dining, but it’s not guaranteed — so booking a drink or meal is the safest bet.\n\nThe food here is truly exceptional. From high-end restaurants to casual bites, everything feels curated, and you don’t have to break the bank if you plan wisely. Downstairs, the Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands mall is stunning — a mix of luxury brands, unique boutiques, and even a canal with gondola rides. Don’t miss the wine and whisky collection store; it’s like walking into a museum of rare bottles.\n\nAt night, the free Spectra light and water show at 8:00 and 9:00 PM outside the mall is a must-see — a dazzling blend of fountains, lasers, and music against the backdrop of the bay. Inside the hotel, the architecture itself is an experience: the world’s largest rooftop infinity pool (hotel guests only), soaring lobbies, and restaurants that rival any luxury destination.\n\nFun facts:\n•\tMarina Bay Sands opened in 2010 and cost around $5.5 billion USD to build.\n•\tThe rooftop SkyPark spans all three towers and could fit four and a half A380 planes end to end.\n•\tThe infinity pool is the longest elevated pool in the world at 150m.\n\nTip: Book a restaurant in advance for sunset, explore the mall before or after, and stay for the evening light show. It’s one of the few luxury experiences where you control how much you spend — and it’s worth every minute.",

From the moment I walked into the grand lobby, I could already feel that this was not just a hotel, but a world-class destination in itself. The scale, the design, and the atmosphere are breathtaking. Everything is built with such attention to detail that you immediately know you’re in one of the most iconic hotels in the world.\n\nThe highlight, of course, is the infinity pool at the SkyPark. I’ve seen it countless times in photos and videos, but being there in person is something else entirely. Swimming at the edge while overlooking the Singapore skyline is surreal—it feels like floating above the entire city. Day or night, the view is spectacular. In the morning, you get the calm and fresh energy of the city waking up, and at night, you’re treated to a dazzling skyline with lights that make the entire experience magical. It’s easily the most unforgettable pool I’ve ever been to.\n\nThe rooms are spacious, modern, and luxuriously comfortable. Floor-to-ceiling windows give you an unbeatable view, whether it’s the Gardens by the Bay or the city skyline. The beds are so comfortable that it’s almost difficult to get up in the morning—except you know you don’t want to waste any time staying in when you’re in such an amazing place. The bathroom amenities are top-notch, and everything feels meticulously maintained and spotless.\n\nDining at Marina Bay Sands is also an experience of its own. The selection of restaurants is phenomenal, from celebrity chef restaurants to local-inspired cuisine, ensuring there’s something for everyone. Every meal feels like part of the luxury experience, with flavors that are memorable and presentation that’s on point. The staff across all the restaurants are highly professional, attentive, and genuinely welcoming.\n\nWhat makes Marina Bay Sands stand out even more is the service. Every staff member I interacted with—from reception, concierge, housekeeping, to the restaurants—was friendly, helpful, and professional. They really go the extra mile to make guests feel taken care of, which is the hallmark of true 5-star hospitality.\n\nBeyond being a hotel, Marina Bay Sands is practically a city within a city. The integrated resort has luxury shopping, the ArtScience Museum, theaters, and direct access to Gardens by the Bay, making it incredibly convenient to explore. The location is unbeatable, with everything you need either within the resort or just a short walk away.\n\nOverall, Marina Bay Sands is not just a hotel stay—it’s an experience. It’s luxurious, iconic, and unforgettable in every sense. Whether you’re traveling for leisure, business, or a special occasion, this place leaves a lasting impression that you’ll treasure for a lifetime. If you want to experience the best of Singapore, there’s no better place than Marina Bay Sands. Absolutely worth every dollar, and I can’t wait to come back again.",

From the moment we arrived at the hotel, the staff were very helpful and polite. They immediately helped us with our luggages which made me felt very welcome.\nThe entire hotel, from the ceiling to the walls are designed with lots of thoughts in mind. Because we arrived way earlier than the check-in time, they arranged a temporary key so we could enjoy the infinity pool while waiting. From the infinity pool, you could see the whole skyline of Singapore. The water temperature is just cool enough to make you feel relaxed but warm enough so that you won’t have a hard time getting out.\nAfter lunch, we came back to check-in and receive our room keys. They had 3 check-in counters, the “normal” one, the VIP one and the Paiza & Limosine one (which is like the Super VIP one). Because the “normal” check in counter was way too long, we got escorted to the Paiza & Limosine to check in. The receptionist there are very kind and quick, she got us our room in less than 5 minutes. Even though I booked the Sands Premier Studio, we got upgraded to the Sands Premier Suite (for free!).\nThe room was much bigger than a standard hotel room, with a separate living area that had a comfortable sofa and a large TV. The bedroom was also spacious and the bed was one of the most comfortable I’ve ever slept in. I really liked the floor-to-ceiling windows, which offered a stunning view of either the city skyline or the Gardens by the Bay. I chose the city view, and it was breathtaking, especially at night.\nThe bathroom was very modern and felt like a spa. It had a big bathtub for two people, which was a nice touch. They also provided very nice toiletries from Jo Malone. The room also had a walk-in wardrobe, which was very useful for keeping the room tidy and getting ready.\nIn conclusion, I would highly recommend the Sands Premier Suite. It’s a very luxurious option that offers excellent comfort, great amenities, and beautiful views. While it is quite expensive, the experience is worth it if you are looking for a special treat.",

From the moment of arriving to a friendly concierge (thank you Raj!), to lovely Sarah at the check in - the room was just beautiful with every small detail thought of. The pool is even better in person (with fantastic service, food and drinks available). So many small details go into making a stay here special - the turn down service, the beautiful amenities (those robes!) and I was even presented with a special box of chocolates to mark an occasion. Already planning my return stay 🩷",

        "review_text": "Marina Bay Sands is, without a doubt, one of the most spectacular hotel experiences I’ve ever had. From the moment you walk into the grand lobby, you’re immersed in luxury, elegance, and impeccable service.\n\nThe infinity pool on the 57th floor is every bit as iconic as it looks in the photos—floating above the city skyline, it offers jaw-dropping panoramic views of Singapore. Watching the sunrise from the pool with a coffee in hand was pure magic.\n\nMy room was spacious, sleek, and sophisticated, with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking either the bay or the city. Every detail felt premium—from the plush bedding to the advanced tech and luxurious bathroom amenities.\n\nDining at Marina Bay Sands is a culinary journey. I had the pleasure of enjoying a world-class dinner at one of the celebrity chef restaurants and also loved the more casual options throughout the property. The buffet breakfast alone is worth writing home about—an incredible spread that caters to every taste.\n\nThe hotel is also in the perfect location—connected to high-end shops, the ArtScience Museum, and just steps from Gardens by the Bay. Whether you want to shop, sightsee, or just unwind in style, everything you need is right there.\n\nIt’s definitely a luxury stay with a luxury price tag, but in my opinion, it’s absolutely worth it for the once-in-a-lifetime experience. Marina Bay Sands isn’t just a hotel—it’s a destination.",

This replaces the Evening Canapés ( which was available only at MBS hotel ).\n\nThe Aperitif Hour ( 5pm-7pm ), plus Breakfast ( 6.30am-10am ) and afternoon tea ( 3pm-5pm ) are made available FOC to guests staying in certain room types.\n\nIn the past 5 weeks, I have tried 5 of the restaurants that participated in the Aperitif Hour. Of the 5 restaurants, I tried 2 of them twice, because they are just so good.\n\nMy reviews, in descending order of ranking , are as follows :-\n\n1.Bread Street Kitchen ( BSK )\n———————————————-\nI tried BSK twice over 5 weeks.\nOf all the Aperitif Hour participating restaurants, this is the BEST ! 👍👍👍\n\nEven though it was only 5pm, the restaurant has a busy and vibrant feel, with courteous staff attending to the needs of diners, who are happily chatting away. This is a happy place 😀😀😀.\n\nBeing a Gordon Ramsay restaurant, the food is, of course, very good. I am very happy that they served their in-house focaccia bread ( with humus ) first, before the arrival of our main orders of Sunday Roast Yorkies, Mini Fish & Chips, and Wagyu Burger Sliders. The delicious focaccia and humus makes the wait for the main orders so much bearable 😜.\n\nEven though it is supposed to be Aperitif Hour, the food BSK served is of such a good size that we skipped dinner thereafter.\n\nThe Wagyu Burger Sliders are so good, that we ordered it both times we are there. ( My dining companion thinks it can give Cut’s Wagyu Sliders a run for their money, but I have to, ahem, differ lah 😅 ).\n\nEven though we did not order any alcoholic beverages ( it’s part of the package ), I note they have a wide selection for connoisseurs. The non-alcoholic Ginger De Pooh, and Belini Junior are refreshingly good.\n\nI will return to BSK for Aperitif Hour or a main meal during my next stay at MBS. 😋😋😋\n\n2.Wakuda\n—————-\nI also tried Wakuda twice over 5 weeks.\n\nWakuda has an understated and quiet elegance. At 5pm, it’s not crowded or busy ( unlike BSK ), and I think many diners may like Wakuda exactly for that.\n\nBeing a sister restaurant to Waku Ghin, its food is very good. I have dined there many times, so having Aperitif Hour at Wakuda allows me to have a different experience there.\n\nI really like their Wagyu Cigar, which is yummy 😋. Their Karage Chicken is extra crispy and delicious .\n\nWakuda is a really good restaurant.\nI will definitely return for a sumptuous dinner with close friends and family… soon.\n\n3.Koma\n————-\nWhen I am served with the food , I am blown away by their presentation… it came on a mini version of their iconic bridge ( which is the backdrop of countless photos of many diners there ). What a nice touch. 👍\n\nWe had the Aperitif Hour at the Bar Lounge instead of the main dining area. The wagyu slider is very good but the portions are relatively small.\n\nI look forward to return to Koma for a main meal again.\n\n4.Yardbird\n——————\nThe quality of the food is good, and the portions are big enough that I skipped dinner thereafter.\n\nI am surprised by the quality and spread of the food at Yardbird, which I have never visited before. I may now visit Yardbird in the near future.\nAt 5pm, the restaurant is relativity quiet.\n\n5.Maison Boulud\n—————————\nWhen I arrived at 5pm, the service staff  assigned me a seat near a window which is scorching hot from the afternoon sun.\n\nThe food portions are very small and the quality average.\n\nThe restaurant itself is very quiet, with only 2 staff serving customers at 5pm.\n\nComments\n——————-\nThe newly introduced Aperitif Hour is a brilliant idea !!!\n\nThis gives the hotel guests a chance to try the excellent food served by the restaurants based at the mall and hotel. Also, it provides the restaurants some business during the quiet hour of 5pm-6pm. A win-win-win for all. 👍👍👍\n\nI look forward to Aperitif Hour being introduced at Cut, Spago, Black Tap etc. 😀😀😀",

We were given and upgrade as it was my birthday along and as we were just staying one night and had a late flight the next day we were offered a replacement keycard for the next day to access the facilities as well as a bookable shower room so we could freshen up before heading to the airport.\n\nThe room was not huge but was so comfortable and well appointed. The bathroom was gorgeous and everything felt fresh and brand new. The tech worked well including wireless charging on the night stands, auto opening curtains and the largest tv I have ever seen in a hotel room.\n\nWe had a great view of the city but immediately changed to try out the infinity pool which is better than I could have ever imagined. The staff are kind but some of the servers could do with a little more training as quite a few mistakes were made. Food and drinks came from nearby Wolfgang Puck Spago and even simple things such as a Caesar salad or burger were really excellent.\n\nIt is open 6am until midnight and we went three times to visit. Don’t forget the hot tubs on the other side of the pool deck.\n\nThe hotel itself is absolutely huge and has a large number of restaurants within it, also a massive shopping mall, nightclub and casino. It is a city within a city.\n\nIt is also close to Gardens on the Bay and a walkway goes through the hotel towards it. But you can’t access the walkway from the hotel and have to exit the hotel and take a small lift and then walk back into the hotel at walkway level. A small detail.\n\nThe location is not great for the city but there is a metro stop nearby and of course it is perfect for all the attractions around the Marina Bay. One day was not enough. I can’t wait to go back.",

Only black taxis( the expensive ones) were around and the valet and doormen were over whelmed. When I was leaving the cost for the black taxi to go to the airport was insane.\nOverall, the crowd put me off immediately to even consider staying at this hotel.\nThere are so many instructions on how to get around the hotel, and which lifts to use.\nI chose to have lunch at the foyer restaurant, as it's seafood buffet had been suggested to me. The restaurant is nice and the staff wonderful. The selection in the multi cuisine buffet stations is excellent, unfortunately with the exception of the seafood station. Prawns, lobster, crayfish, scallops arrive frozen from origin, then thawed and place on ice. All these were soggy, tasteless and chewy. I would avoid these.\nThe Sushi/Sashimi station is excellent.\nThe food in rest of the stations was also excellent.\nI visited the pool, which was again very crowded. I don't care how good a view a pool has, the crowd here was intolerable.\nThe top level restaurants and bars have a lovely view, so lunch or dinner would be a nice experience.",

        "review_text": "Our visit to Marina Bay Sands was a memorable one, especially the experience of going to the top and witnessing the spectacular views of Singapore’s skyline. The coordination by the staff was commendable. Although we initially faced a small issue with our ticket not scanning properly, the team handled it with genuine warmth and professionalism. They reassured us not to worry, quickly sorted out the problem, and welcomed us with a friendly smile, which really set the tone for a great experience.\n\nOnce we reached the top, the view was undeniably impressive—stretching across iconic landmarks like the Singapore Flyer, Gardens by the Bay, and the endless expanse of city and sea. Everything was immaculately maintained, from the observation deck to the common areas. Cleanliness and upkeep clearly seem to be a top priority here.\n\nThat said, there are a few areas where the experience could be elevated further. Tourists today look for more interactive and immersive elements. Simple additions—like informative or engaging video displays inside the lifts (similar to what Burj Khalifa offers)—can really enhance the journey upward. Even having touch-screen installations at the top showcasing the history or stories of the buildings in view could add value.\n\nAlso, visiting during the daytime can be quite uncomfortable due to the harsh sun and heat. Some shaded or misted zones, or even cooling stations, would allow visitors to enjoy their time without feeling the need to rush through it.\n\nOverall, Marina Bay Sands offers an iconic view, with a great team on the ground—but with just a few tweaks, it could offer a more memorable and comfortable experience for all.",

We only stayed there for 1 night as it's quite expensive & I'm usually quite a budget conscious person, so I don't usually stay at 5 star hotels, but the MBS hotel service is second to none. After getting there, we were immediately offered assistance with our luggage by staff, which was brought upstairs for us. The check in & check out process is seamless & straight-forward.\nI'm not a gambler, so I didn't go to the casino, but I do like to keep my fitness up whilst I'm away, so I do recommend their gym. It is a fair walk from the rooms, but the variety of equipment was fantastic & it's a 24 hour gym too.\nObviously, you also can't go past the Infinity Pool whilst you're at MBS. Just remember to take your hotel key card with you when you go up.\nOverall, despite the high price tag, I do recommend MBS if you do stay in Singapore, even if it's just for 1 night.",

Unfortunately, it was a disappointing experience.\n\nOn the first day, we waited for two full hours during check-in because the hotel said our room had a smoke odor. As compensation, we were given USD 150.\n\nHowever, on the second night, we noticed the room still had a strong smell of smoke. The manager brought in a machine, saying it used a “natural solution” to remove the odor. I told them this was unacceptable—we have a child, and we couldn’t tolerate this for the rest of our holiday. I requested a room change or an upgrade, but the manager only said they would report it and then completely ignored us afterward.\n\nThis is the second time this year we’ve stayed here as a family, but sadly, it will be the last. A hotel of this level should take better care of its guests.",

My amazing boyfriend, Donkey, surprised me with a stay at the luxurious MBS Hotel Suites, and the entire experience was pure bliss! From the moment we arrived, we were enveloped in an atmosphere of unparalleled elegance and sophistication. The suite itself was breathtaking & spacious, impeccably designed, and boasting floor to ceiling windows offering stunning panoramic views of the city skyline and Gardens by the Bay. The plush furnishings, state of the art amenities (I especially loved the deep-soaking tub!), and the sheer opulence of the space created an unforgettable experience. Simply relaxing and enjoying the breathtaking views was pure bliss. The service was generally impeccable, the staff were friendly, attentive, and always ready to assist with a smile. Dining at one of the hotel's many exceptional restaurants was a highlight, and the Sands Skypark infinity pool provided an unforgettable backdrop for a celebratory swim.  The only minor drawback was a slight delay in room service, we requested shower gel via the in-room TV system and waited approximately 45 minutes before having to call directly to expedite the request. However, this small inconvenience was easily overshadowed by the overall magnificence of our stay.

We stayed in one of the newly upgraded rooms and it was stunning. We were treated like royalty! The staff gave us a bottle of bubbles and a cake for our celebration, and there wasn't one thing we would change about our stay. The new rooms are gorgeous, and have one of the most beautiful bathrooms I've been in. Cannot speak highly enough about the \"new\" MBS - I never felt the old rooms really lives up to the price tag, but the new ones definitely do.",

The skyline is absolutely breathtaking, especially at night when the city lights reflect beautifully off the bay. The entire area is impeccably clean, safe, and well-organized—perfect for a relaxing stroll or a romantic evening.\n\nHighlights for me included the Marina Bay Sands SkyPark with its stunning panoramic views, the Spectra Light & Water Show, and the Gardens by the Bay, especially the Supertree Grove. There's also fantastic dining nearby, from street food to fine restaurants with amazing views.\n\nIt’s a perfect blend of nature, technology, and luxury. Whether you’re a tourist or a local, Marina Bay offers something memorable for everyone. Highly recommended!",

Knowing the suite was a significant investment, we decided to maximize our time indulging in the luxurious amenities and breathtaking views from our room. While we did venture out, we primarily focused on enjoying the comfort and elegance of our suite, interspersed with a special dinner at the Paiza Sky Residence.\n\nThe suite itself was incredibly spacious and elegantly appointed, offering stunning panoramic views of the city skyline and Marina Bay. Kitty particularly loved the sheer size of the room, commenting on how much space there was to relax and unwind. The luxurious bedding and amenities were top-notch, but what truly impressed her was the luxurious bathroom. The enormous bathtub with a built-in jacuzzi was a standout feature, and the in-built bathroom TV added an extra touch of luxury.  She spent a considerable amount of time luxuriating in the tub, enjoying the jets and the in-bathroom entertainment.  We also made use of the in-room karaoke system (KTV), enjoying a fun and relaxing night of singing.\n\nOur dinner at the Paiza Sky Residence was, without a doubt, a highlight. The service was impeccable, the food exquisite, and the ambience sophisticated and elegant. The panoramic views from the Sky Residence were equally stunning, offering a different perspective on the city skyline compared to our suite.\n\nEven the little details were impressive. Kitty particularly enjoyed the high-quality toiletries provided. The  body lotion, hair shampoo, and conditioner all smelled divine. The complimentary drinks and fresh fruit in the room were a welcome touch. Everything was immaculately clean and seamlessly arranged, adding to the overall luxurious experience.\n\nWhile we did briefly explore The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands and the SkyPark Observation Deck having a short swin at the infinity pool, the majority of our stay was spent luxuriating in our suite and enjoying the exceptional dining experience at the Sky Residence. It was a splurge, but for a special occasion like Kitty's birthday, it was absolutely worth it.",

At night, the entire bay lights up beautifully, creating an unforgettable atmosphere. The nightly light and water shows are truly a spectacle, adding to the area’s magical charm.\n\nMarina Bay Sands is also very tourist-friendly.

Combined with the elegance of Marina Bay Sands, it made for a once-in-a-lifetime experience.\n\nHighly recommended for any visitor to Singapore.\n\nLet me know if you want to add hotel-specific feedback or highlight anything else like shopping, food, or the pool!",

He was told that he would be contacted by HR on Monday which is astonishing. We’ve contacted your front desk and from what we’ve been told, HR is on it but we don’t know when we’ll be called. We have contacted MOM about this because the situation is beyond unfair- this is a man who’s elderly and who is getting his eye fixed. He’s not blind or sick. This smacks of unfair termination, and his supervisor should’ve gone through the right channels and or tried to help him. He knows that his only issue is his diabetes which doesn’t make him ill. Well, we hope that the Hr will get back as soon as possible. Either way, we have contacted MOM about this unfair treatment and we hope that this issue can be solved soon. Imagine doing this to an elderly person who has worked hard for your company for ages, is always early and makes sure he’s on time. This is awful.",

It’s only accessible to hotel guests, but if you get the chance to stay, it’s worth it for that view alone. There’s also a public observation deck if you're not staying at the hotel.\n\nInside, MBS features a high-end shopping mall with luxury brands, a canal with gondola rides, and a wide variety of restaurants—from celebrity chef fine dining to local delicacies. The ArtScience Museum and nightly Spectra light and water show at the promenade are great additions that make it a complete entertainment destination.\n\nIt’s directly connected to Gardens by the Bay via a beautiful pedestrian bridge, and the Bayfront MRT station is just below the complex, making it super accessible.\n\nWhether you're staying the night, coming for a show, or just enjoying the views, Marina Bay Sands offers a world-class experience in the heart of Singapore.",

        "review_text": "Marina Bay Sands in Singapore is a landmark that has become synonymous with luxury and innovation since its opening in 2011. Located on the waterfront of Marina Bay, the resort features an iconic design with three interconnected towers, topped by the Sands SkyPark, which boasts the world’s largest infinity pool. This rooftop area offers stunning panoramic views of Singapore’s skyline, creating a unique experience for hotel guests.\n\nThe resort offers 1,850 rooms and suites, ranging from elegant Premier Rooms to the ultra-luxurious Paiza Collection. The rooms are designed with modern sophistication, featuring plush furnishings, marble bathrooms, and the latest in-room technology. Guests staying in the Paiza Collection enjoy exclusive benefits, including butler service, private lounge access, and enhanced privileges at the SkyPark.\n\nMarina Bay Sands is also home to an impressive selection of dining options, with over 80 restaurants and bars. Renowned chefs like Wolfgang Puck, Gordon Ramsay, and Tetsuya Wakuda have established eateries here, offering a variety of world-class culinary experiences. The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands, an upscale shopping mall, features more than 300 luxury stores, while the ArtScience Museum offers an intriguing mix of exhibitions that combine art, science, and technology.\n\nEntertainment options at the resort are abundant. The light and water show, Spectra, is a nightly spectacle, and the MARQUEE nightclub adds to the vibrant nightlife scene. The casino, along with a theater hosting international performances and a large convention center, ensures that there’s always something to do. For those looking for relaxation, the Banyan Tree Spa provides a range of luxurious treatments, and the fitness center is equipped with state-of-the-art facilities.\n\nOne downside to consider is the resort’s sheer size, which can lead to crowded public areas, especially during peak seasons. Guests have occasionally mentioned longer wait times for certain amenities. Despite this, the vast array of services and the exceptional level of service offered at Marina Bay Sands often outweigh these inconveniences.\n\nMarina Bay Sands is a top-tier destination for travelers seeking a luxurious all-in-one resort experience. Whether you’re enjoying the infinity pool, dining at world-class restaurants, shopping, or indulging in the entertainment, the resort offers something for everyone, making it a standout choice when visiting Singapore.",

        "review_text": "Marina Bay Sands isn’t just a hotel—it's an icon that defines the Singapore skyline and an immersive experience in luxury, architecture, and entertainment. From the moment you enter, you're surrounded by a sense of scale and grandeur that few hotels in the world can match. The triple-tower structure, connected at the top by the SkyPark, feels futuristic yet harmoniously integrated with the Marina Bay waterfront.\n\nI stayed in a Premier Room on a high floor, and the view from the floor-to-ceiling windows was absolutely unforgettable—overlooking Gardens by the Bay and the Singapore Strait. The room itself was luxurious yet understated, with thoughtful design touches, a spacious bathroom with a rain shower, and everything you’d expect from a world-class 5-star property.\n\nOf course, the highlight was the infinity pool. It's reserved for hotel guests only and lives up to every bit of hype. Watching the city skyline glow at dusk while swimming 57 stories up was something I’ll remember forever. The SkyPark observation deck, accessible to the public for a fee, is also fantastic for views and photos.\n\nDining was equally stellar—LAVO had one of the best Italian meals I’ve had in Asia, and breakfast at Rise was generous, varied, and well-executed. The integrated shopping mall downstairs (The Shoppes) has everything from Louis Vuitton to artisanal coffee shops. You’ll also find the ArtScience Museum here, with its lotus-like design and rotating exhibitions.\n\nYes, it’s expensive. But for what you’re getting—the architecture, the views, the facilities, the sheer wow-factor—it’s one of those places worth splurging on at least once. Tip: Book early and request a higher floor with a pool-facing view",

A buffet breakfast was included, but oh my goodness, it was extremely busy no matter what time we attended. One day, there were over 70 people in the queue waiting to be seated. We sent an email to the hotel, as one day, our allocated table was next to a door for anyone to go outside into the garden dining area. This particular breakfast wasn't enjoyable as it was a constant thoroughfare with so many other guests squeezing past. We received a phone call within a few minutes of sending our email. They understood our issue but didn't offer any solution. We weren't offered this table again 🙏 The said table was still in place the following day! We also sadly noticed the huge amount of food being wasted from a lot of guests.\nWe had a couple of issues having to wait, one was for some wine we had ordered for our room, we eventually after almost an hour of waiting received a call to advise the wine wasn't available!\nThe room itself was lovely & the views were beautiful. Overall the staff were extremely polite & very helpful.\nThe main thoroughfare near to reception is extremely busy, with anyone being able to access not just guests staying at the hotel as the shopping mall/cinema/casino/restaurants, etc, are accessible from here.\nWe do hope the infrastructure is being carefully considered whilst Tower 4 is being constructed, as the number of people moving through & around is extremely busy!!\nThe infinity pool was amazing though & enjoyable 😎",

Wow, what can I say other than this hotel is absolutely fantastic, from the lobby right up to the roof top infinity pool. Every member of staff, regardless of their role, are so friendly and go out of their way to make your stay one to remember. The rooms are very spacious and beautifully presented, with all mod cons... Even the toilet is operated electronically. Took me by surprise 😮.  I can't praise this hotel and it's staff enough, simply amazing",

The view at the top is truly amazing. I stayed there on a Tuesday in October. I got upgraded to a bayside suite room in Tower 3 in a newly renovated room and was able to watch the light show at the Gardens by the Bay which happens twice a night. The service was amazing and despite being such a big hotel, I did not feel lost or without attention. There is also a laser light show at the marina bay sands complex at night which was fun. Get there early to secure good seats. The area is fun to walk around or jog. There is also a mall attached and a casino. (Did not go so can’t comment)",

The room was beautiful and has some of the most impressive latest technology and the service is truly quite amazing.  And of course  - the rooftop infinity pool is one of a kind in this world.\n\nWe were fortunate enough to stay at the room facing Gardens by the bay with a large walk-out balcony. While the room was quite small, it was jam-packed with all kinds of tech features that even blow the Japanese hotels away.\n\nThe  service was absolutely remarkable. Any need was fulfilled within 10 mins or less from the call, and the staff truly cared about ones comfort.\n\nThe breakfast had the \"quantity over quality\" feel to it. As to be expected,  the spread was quite massive, with quite massive crowds to boot. Best to go before 08:30am to avoid any lines.\n\nOf course, the rooftop infinity pool is a 10/10. Incredible in every way, a true modern marvel. We visited several times through several days and even at night and found plenty of loungers available. Staff was there to provide quick drink and snack service as well.\n\nOverall , I was left impressed with the MBS. The room was impeccably clean and showed zero signs of wear. Its quite impressive how such a large enterprise can keep the service level so high. And the service was amazing, but one does feel a bit like a number based on the size of the hotel. Would definitely stay here again.",

        "review_text": "A seaside hotel that captures the imagination often blends natural beauty with human-centric design, creating an immersive escape from the mundane. Here’s a multidimensional portrayal of an ideal coastal retreat:\n\n**1. Symbiosis with the Ocean**\n- **Boundless Vistas**: Perched atop a crescent-shaped bay, every suite features 270-degree floor-to-ceiling windows. The tides become a living mural, while the \"Golden Hour of the Sea\" during dawn and dusk offers a private visual feast.\n- **Exclusive Shoreline**: A private 800-meter white sand beach pairs with a tidal monitoring system that alerts guests to optimal tide-pooling times. Guided explorations reveal hidden intertidal ecosystems at low tide.\n\n**2. Architectural Poetry**\n- **Cultural Reverence**: Inspired by traditional fishing village dwellings, the terraced structure boasts a façade embedded with millions of recycled seashells, their undulating textures shimmering like sunlit waves.\n- **Liquid Aesthetics**: The lobby dazzles with 3,000 hand-blown glass jellyfish lamps. Ocean breezes animate the space, casting rippling shadows that transform check-in into an aquatic overture.\n\n**3. Sensory Sanctuary**\n- **Smart Ambiance**: Beds auto-adjust to body contours, while voice-controlled systems cycle through soundscapes like \"coral reef white noise\" or \"dolphin frequency.\" Mineral-seaweed aromas diffuse via circadian-rhythm scent systems.\n- **Marine Interaction**: Balconies house underwater periscopes; UV night mode unveils bioluminescent plankton. A cabin journal logs daily sightings of rare marine species.\n\n**4. Reimagined Ocean Experiences**\n- **Tidal Gastronomy**: A 18-course \"Marine Evolution\" tasting menu evolves with daily catches. Glass-floored dining platforms frame schools of fish darting beneath diners’ feet.\n- **Abyssal Meditation**: Collaborating with oceanographers, transparent submersible pods host singing bowl sessions at 20-meter depths, where humpback whale songs resonate through the hull.\n\n**5. Sustainable Innovation**\n- Tidal energy meets 60% of power needs; greywater nourishes vertical algae walls that filter CO₂.\n- The \"Coral Adoption Program\" lets guests plant reefs for carbon credits, redeemable for eco-experiences like nocturnal squid tagging.\n\nMore than a hotel, it’s a portal to marine consciousness—when bare feet touch moon-warmed sands and smart tidal bracelets pulse to signal a bioluminescent bloom, worldly identities dissolve with the receding tide, leaving only the true self in whispered dialogue with the eternal sea.",

The food offered as part of the booking (buffet style) is more likely to be the left overs from A La Carte menu on the other side of the restaurant.

The complex consists of three towering hotel blocks connected at the top by the SkyPark, an engineering marvel that offers panoramic views of the city skyline and Marina Bay.\n\nOne of the biggest draws is the world-famous infinity pool, located on the rooftop. Reserved exclusively for hotel guests, the pool provides an unforgettable experience—floating above the city while enjoying spectacular views. Many visitors book at least one night’s stay just to access it, and while prices can be high, booking during off-peak periods or through special promotions can help you save significantly.\n\nBeyond the pool, the resort is home to a large shopping mall, a casino, and a wide variety of dining options ranging from food court fare to high-end restaurants by celebrity chefs. The quality of food across the property is consistently excellent.\n\nWhat makes Marina Bay Sands truly special is its dual perspective: you can enjoy stunning views of both the futuristic Gardens by the Bay and the dazzling city skyline, especially at night when the lights come alive.\n\nWhether you’re staying overnight, dining, or just visiting the observation deck, it’s an experience that’s absolutely worth having at least once in your lifetime.",

The iconic property boasts breathtaking landscapes that immediately transport you to a world of luxury and elegance. While my visit was brief, I was able to immerse myself in the grandeur that Marina Bay Sands is renowned for.\n\nUpon arrival, I regretfully missed the opportunity to dine at their Italian restaurant due to its closing hours. Nevertheless, I was compensated by the exceptional service and warm hospitality extended by the staff, making me feel welcome and valued throughout my stay.\n\nOne highlight of my visit was the casino experience, even though I am not a gambling enthusiast. Watching my friend revel in the excitement of the baccarat table was a joy in itself. The refreshing lemonade cucumber tea served at the casino instantly became a favorite, earning the amusing moniker \"hot mountain dew\" from us.\n\nWhile exploring the expansive mall area, I marveled at the architecture and design surrounding me. The sheer scale of the mall was impressive, filled with an array of stores and amenities that cater to every need and desire. Although I missed the chance to fully indulge in retail therapy due to the late hour, the ambiance alone was enough to leave a lasting impression.\n\nDespite the closing time of most establishments in the mall, we found solace in dining at the exclusive club restaurant. The culinary experience was nothing short of exceptional, offering a delectable array of dishes that tantalized our taste buds and left us craving for more. The impeccable service and attention to detail truly elevated our dining experience to a new level of luxury.\n\nOne cannot help but appreciate the intricate beauty and craftsmanship that permeates every corner of Marina Bay Sands. From the lavish decor to the stunning views of the surrounding cityscape, every aspect of the property exudes sophistication and opulence. The meticulous attention to detail is evident in every aspect of the hotel, ensuring a seamless and unforgettable experience for every guest.\n\nThe unparalleled views from the observation deck left me in awe of the panoramic vistas that stretched as far as the eye could see. The expansive skyline of Singapore, coupled with the stunning waterfront views, created a mesmerizing backdrop that encapsulated the essence of urban beauty and modernity.\n\nThroughout my stay, I was consistently impressed by the level of service and professionalism displayed by the staff at Marina Bay Sands. Their dedication to ensuring the comfort and satisfaction of guests was commendable, making me feel valued and appreciated at every interaction.\n\nIn conclusion, Marina Bay Sands Singapore is a true gem that offers a luxurious and immersive experience like no other. From the exquisite landscapes to the world-class amenities and exceptional service, every aspect of the property is designed to exceed expectations and create lasting memories. My short but unforgettable stay at Marina Bay Sands has left me eager to return and indulge in all the wonders this iconic destination has to offer.",

People are very friendly and want to help you to be as comfortable as possible.\nThe hotel room we stayed in was an original room (now they are going through renovation and upgraded rooms have new furniture) and it was a good size, with a massive TV and nice bathroom.\nThe main attraction of this place is the rooftop pool with an amazing view of the bay and the city. The sunrise was beautiful and nighttime there was fun as well.\nThe location is great, since you have walking distance to the Gardens by the Bay, shopping and great restaurants.",

The architecture is iconic, and the view from the SkyPark is absolutely breathtaking, offering panoramic vistas of Singapore’s skyline that are worth the visit alone.\n\nThe rooms are spacious, modern, and well-appointed, with many offering stunning views of the bay. The infinity pool is the star attraction—swimming at the top of the world is an experience that you simply can’t miss. It’s a bit crowded at times, but the view and atmosphere make it worth it.\n\nBeyond the rooms and pool, the complex has everything you could need—high-end shopping, world-class dining, and a casino. The staff are attentive and ensure your stay is as comfortable as possible.\n\nMarina Bay Sands isn’t just a hotel; it’s a destination in itself. Whether you’re staying here or just visiting, it’s an experience that defines luxury in Singapore. Highly recommended for anyone looking to indulge in the best the city has to offer.\n\nYou can modify it based on your personal experience or preferences!",

The atmosphere was vibrant, and the architecture itself was impressive, adding to the overall experience.\n\nAfter exploring the mall, we took a leisurely walk through the surrounding areas, which offered stunning views of the city skyline. The walk across to Gardens by the Bay was particularly enjoyable, as it provided a perfect blend of modernity and nature. Our friends were captivated by the seamless transition from the bustling mall to the serene gardens.

Ultra flashy retail (anyone need to pick up a Patek Philippe before dinner?), fancy dinning options etc, but decidedly Singapore. So more hushed tones, politeness and order than the average casino resort.\n\nRoof top pool is actually epic, and staff super friendly and attentive. Looks as good as the pictures.\n\nRoom was very nice, well sized, all the tech and a TV as big as a house. We had a balcony with a view of the gardens and would say that is a great option.",

The pool is also incredible! Staff is friendly there as well though reasonably strict about only allowing guests through (do NOT lose your room key!).

Allowing guests to enjoy top notch dining in a top-notch room with top-notch views.\n\nAnd I didn't even get to the insane infinity pool on top of the building 🙂\n\nIf you're thinking of booking one night, strongly consider booking two to have one full day without worrying about logistics.",

Fantastic casino, all of the best restaurants, and shopping (usually looking not buying at the high end stores) will keep you plenty entertained. Then you've got Universal Studios and a plethora of other tourist activities all within walking distance of here.",

I don't know how much money it took to build this, but they thought of a lot.  First, they have the best food court that I have ever been to.  I've been here several times now and the prices are slightly higher, but the cuisine is really good with all booths.  It is like a high quality Hawker Center or something.  Plus, there is a Subway that goes right through the middle of it.  The Downtown line comes directly to this mall! Plus, in case you didn't know this already, you can actually walk on top of this mall!  There is an elevator to the top, and the view from here is amazing!  Not only that, but you can also walk directly to the Supertree Forest, via a special walkway which they have built between the two locations, saving you all kinds of time.  There is a lotus lake outside which almost nobody visits, which is a great place to enjoy some Tea or Coffee.  There is a casino here, and a lot more.  But you have got to see this place to believe it.",

The executive room was fab and appeared like bigger than 3 bed flat.  City view from room and lounge area was amazing. Room was on 45th floor. Hi Tech touch panel everywhere to control lights, curtains and AC. Fully automatic smart toilet with touch panel, what a luxury !! Jacuzzi, 12 point shower panel, 2 wash basin in bathroom and a tv in front of bath. Separate dressing area, dining area, bar area, lounge area with 6 seater sofa having 75 inch TV. It was fab. Only thing I didnt like was the big queue for breakfast. This hotel is super expensive and seeing guests standing in a long queue was no pleasure at all. Then, though we were upgraded to executive room but were denied breakfast since it wasnt part of my original booking but executive suits cones with by default breakfast. Its like getting upgraded to business class from economy class but cabin crew serving you food of economy class which is rare or I have never heard of. Singapore is heaven for food and we wanted to explore local food hence it wasnt an issue at all but this is something MBS management shoul look into and consider my airlones analogy. Infinity pool, observation deck was easily accessible.",

After using most of our complementary coffee capsules, they even gave us one more of each and plenty of sweets. Minibar is well stocked with a good variety of snacks, softdrinks and even a shaker to make your own cocktails. Even the size of the coffee was adjusted to match their cups.\nRooms are clean and of high quality interior. You can control all lighting, do not disturb and Ac from each side of your bed, which was a nice add on. When we left they put a number of glass cleaning clothes and even a cable organizer + amenities to take with us.\n\nProbably the best city hotel I have ever stayed at. Definitely worth the money, don't look any further.\n\nThank you for having us!",

Located in the heart of the city, it is renowned for its striking design, featuring three interconnected towers topped by the SkyPark, which provides panoramic views of the Singapore skyline.\n\nThe hotel boasts opulent rooms and suites with modern amenities, elegant furnishings, and floor-to-ceiling windows that showcase breathtaking city or sea views. The service is exemplary, with staff going above and beyond to ensure a seamless stay.\n\nThe highlight of Marina Bay Sands is undoubtedly the Infinity Pool on the SkyPark, which is the world’s largest rooftop pool. Floating on the edge of the pool while gazing at the cityscape is an unforgettable experience. The SkyPark also houses observation decks and restaurants offering gourmet dining, further elevating the luxury quotient.\n\nFor entertainment, Marina Bay Sands has something for everyone. The integrated resort includes a high-end shopping mall, an impressive casino, and the ArtScience Museum, which hosts cutting-edge exhibitions. The theater regularly features international performances, adding to the cultural allure.\n\nWhile the experience is undoubtedly luxurious, it comes with a premium price tag. Some guests might find the property bustling, especially during peak tourist seasons. However, the overall ambiance, impeccable service, and unmatched facilities make it worth the splurge.\n\nIn conclusion, Marina Bay Sands is more than just a hotel—it’s a destination in itself, perfect for those seeking indulgence, entertainment, and iconic memories in Singapore.",

        "review_text": "A Sky-High Experience with Spectacular Views\n\nWe visited hotel’s observation deck. This observation deck offers a panoramic view of the city that is truly breathtaking.\n\nThe primary draw of the Marina Bay Sands Observation Deck is, of course, the view. From this vantage point, you get an unobstructed, 360-degree view of Singapore’s stunning skyline, the bustling Marina Bay, and the vast expanse of the sea stretching into the distance. On a clear day, you can see as far as Indonesian lands.\n\nThe view encompasses some of Singapore’s most iconic landmarks. You’ll see the lush greenery and futuristic structures of Gardens by the Bay, including the Supertree Grove and the two glass conservatories. The sight of the Marina Bay area from above, including the Merlion, the Esplanade, and the Singapore Flyer, is particularly striking. As the sun sets, the city transitions into a vibrant display of lights, making the evening visit a magical experience. The colors reflecting off the bay and the dazzling city lights make it an ideal spot for photographers.\n\nThe Observation Deck itself is expansive, offering plenty of room to move around and take in the views from different angles. Unlike other observation decks that might feel cramped, this one provides ample space for everyone to enjoy the view without feeling crowded, even during peak hours. The deck is designed to ensure safety while providing an open, airy feel.\n\nOne of the unique aspects of the deck is its open-air design. Unlike enclosed observation decks with glass barriers, the Marina Bay Sands deck offers an unobstructed view, allowing you to fully immerse yourself in the surroundings. The feeling of standing 57 floors above ground, with the wind in your hair and the city sprawled out beneath you, is exhilarating.\n\nTo get the most out of your visit, I recommend timing your trip to coincide with sunset. Arriving about an hour before sunset allows you to experience the transition from day to night. Watching the sun dip below the horizon, casting a warm golden hue over the city, is a moment of pure beauty. As day turns to night, the city’s lights begin to sparkle, creating a mesmerizing scene that’s perfect for capturing on camera.\n\nAnother highlight of an evening visit is the nightly Spectra Light and Water Show at Marina Bay Sands. From the Observation Deck, you get a unique, bird’s-eye view of this show, which combines dancing fountains, colorful lights, and music in a spectacular display. The view from above adds an extra dimension to the experience, allowing you to appreciate the choreography of the water jets and lights in their entirety.\n\nThe Observation Deck also offers a few additional amenities that enhance the experience. There’s a small bar where you can purchase drinks and snacks, allowing you to relax and enjoy the view with a refreshing beverage in hand.\n\nIt’s worth noting that the open-air design means it can get quite hot during the day, so bringing sunscreen and a hat is advisable if you’re visiting earlier in the day.",

From the moment I set foot in this iconic hotel, I was spellbound by the sheer beauty of the bay area and the rich cultural experiences that surrounded me.\n\nThe first thing that left me in awe was the breathtaking view of the city skyline from the rooftop infinity pool. The sight of the glittering skyscrapers and the stunning Marina Bay was nothing short of magical, especially during the evening when the city lights up. I could have spent hours just soaking in this incredible panorama.\n\nThe Bay Area itself is a sight to behold. The calm waters of the bay, juxtaposed with the bustling cityscape, create a unique and captivating atmosphere. A leisurely stroll along the bay promenade allowed me to absorb the vibrant energy of this place and appreciate the blend of modernity and tradition that Singapore so perfectly encapsulates.\n\nOverall, my visit to Marina Bay Sands in Singapore was nothing short of extraordinary. The hotel, the bay area, and the cultural experiences exceeded my expectations and made my first trip to Singapore a memorable one. If you're seeking a blend of luxury, culture, and breathtaking views, this is the place to be. I left with a heavy heart, but with memories I will cherish for a lifetime.",

Being able to wake up and enjoy the stunning vistas each morning was truly a treat. Swimming in the infinity pool was an experience I'll never forget.\n\nWhat really sets Marina Bay Sands apart, though, was the exceptional level of service. The resort provided me with temporary cards that allowed me to access the swimming pool and reserve time slots for the shower facilities, even after I had checked out. This thoughtful touch ensured that I could continue to enjoy the resort's amenities on my final day, without any hassle.\n\nI cannot recommend Marina Bay Sands highly enough.

The Merlin however wasn't functional. One of the best place to visit.",

Room was big and clean, however, it looked a bit tired with nicks and scratches on the furnishings! I expected being that it is a highly praised and visible hotel that everything would be on the luxurious side, but I have seen better. On the brighter side, the hotel is centrally located with all the highlights of what Singapore has to offer within walking distance. The hotel also boasts a high-end mall with food court. It does get extremely busy so plan accordingly if you'd like to get something to eat and to see any light shows, need to show up at least an hour before to get prime spot. Any the infinity pool was amazing overlooking the city! We went at 6 am in the morning for a swim and no one was around until about 6:30 am then the crowd started to build up. All in all, it was an amazing stay and would still recommend the hotel!",

Both rooms had superb views over the supertree grove and glass houses so we could watch the light show from our balcony.  We got priority  access to the observation  deck and visited the pool twice. Loved the fact there  was an adult only area, too.\nWe didn't dine there, and the only issue  I have is the fact that everything  in Singapore  harbour area that's good gets booked far in advance.  We were warned about this the day before check-in and didn't  do anything about it. My advice would be to choose a restaurant  within the hotel as they are excellent (not like hotel food in the UK), and come highly  recommended  on Trip Advisor.\n\nAll in all, it was an amazing  experience.  Would love to come again someday, and I will sort out eateries before  we arrive!",

        "review_text": "Marina Bay Sands is one of Singapore’s most iconic landmarks, a luxury hotel that is more than just a place to stay—it’s an experience in itself. During my recent visit, I was left in awe of its architectural grandeur, world-class amenities, and stunning views. Adding to this, my dining experience at LAVO Italian Restaurant & Rooftop Bar was a highlight of the trip, though there were some areas where it could have been better.\n\n**Marina Bay Sands Experience:**\n\nFrom the moment you arrive at Marina Bay Sands, the sheer scale of the place is impressive. The hotel consists of three massive towers connected by a SkyPark, which offers one of the best panoramic views of the city. Checking in was seamless despite the large number of guests, and the staff were attentive and professional throughout our stay.\n\nThe rooms were spacious, well-appointed, and offered floor-to-ceiling windows with breathtaking views of Singapore’s skyline or the bay. The attention to detail in the rooms, from the plush bedding to the luxurious bathrooms, made our stay incredibly comfortable. The location of Marina Bay Sands is also unbeatable—it’s situated near many of Singapore’s key attractions, such as Gardens by the Bay, the ArtScience Museum, and the Merlion, making it perfect for tourists looking to explore the city.\n\nHowever, what sets Marina Bay Sands apart is its world-famous infinity pool located on the 57th floor. Floating in the pool while taking in the views of the city skyline is an experience you won’t forget. It’s worth noting that the pool area does get crowded, especially during peak hours, so it’s best to visit early in the morning or late in the evening for a more relaxed atmosphere.\n\nFor entertainment, Marina Bay Sands also boasts a world-class casino, high-end shopping at The Shoppes, and an array of restaurants, bars, and cafes. The hotel’s wide variety of dining options ensures there’s something for everyone, from casual eateries to fine dining.\n\n**Dining at LAVO Restaurant:**\n\nOne of the dining highlights at Marina Bay Sands was our dinner at LAVO Italian Restaurant & Rooftop Bar. Situated on the 57th floor, LAVO offers stunning 360-degree views of Singapore’s skyline, and the ambiance is unbeatable. The warm lighting, plush seating, and open-air terrace create a sophisticated yet relaxed atmosphere. Whether you’re seated indoors or outdoors, you’re in for a visual treat.\n\nLAVO’s menu is an impressive mix of Italian-American cuisine. We started with the *Fried Calamari* and *Meatball*, both of which were delicious. The calamari was perfectly crisp, and the meatball was tender and flavorful, served in a rich tomato sauce. For our main course, we ordered the *Spaghetti Carbonara* and *Lobster Ravioli*. The carbonara was creamy and flavorful, though slightly on the heavier side, while the lobster ravioli was a standout dish, with perfectly cooked pasta and generous portions of lobster.\n\nHowever, as much as we enjoyed the food, the prices were on the higher side, which is to be expected given the prime location. The service, while friendly, could have been more attentive. It took longer than expected for our orders to be taken, and the food arrived slightly later than anticipated. While the ambiance and views made up for the slight delays, it’s something that could be improved for a more seamless dining experience.\n\nThe rooftop bar at LAVO is a must-visit for anyone looking to enjoy cocktails with a view. The drinks were well-crafted, and sipping a cocktail while watching the city lights come to life was a memorable experience.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nMarina Bay Sands is a premier destination in Singapore, offering a luxurious stay with unparalleled views, world-class amenities, and a range of dining options. The infinity pool alone makes it worth the visit, and its location is perfect for exploring Singapore. LAVO Restaurant, with its stunning views and delicious Italian-American cuisine, is a great dining spot, though a few tweaks in service would make it even better. Overall, both the hotel and restaurant was amazing.",

It was fine, in terms of the food and drinks on offer, but it was overcrowded and the staff, salary, didn't really offer a great service.

Make sure you have reservations.\nService - it is a hit or miss- at times you feel pampered and cared for, at times ignored.\nGive yourself some time to eat from one place to another.

The pool is amazing, I did not think I would be that amazed but I was speechless once in it. The pool has a booking system of an hour and 15 minutes. We felt that it was very well organized by the whole staff considering the pandemic. At least it wasn't crowded at all. :) We tried the gym, too. It was nice, had decent equipment with a gorgeous view. All the staff was amazing. It was a perfect stay.",

I found the staff quite unfriendly and would not even greet their guests which I found odd. I mentioned to them in an email exchange that we will be staying for our anniversary and they said they will be sending a dessert over once we check in which they didn’t.

Do not attempt online checkin, because then your stuff won’t reach your room from the drop-off and there will be issues with the online deposit. This simply does not work as you would expect. The room is quite nice on higher floors, but they started some maintenance next to our room and as they left an emergency exit open and blocked the beeping noise was quite disturbing in our room during the night. We were offered a new room, but as we would had to move our staff the night before our checkout, it did not make any sense. We would have expected much more from such a high ranked hotel and considering these it does not worth the money. Maybe one time to check the pool. I never had to call or contact the front desk so often in any other hotel like here, and we are not picky at all. The service is nice and the staff is polite but not flexible at all. Mixing business people with people on vacation is also not a great idea.",

We've been waiting 15 minutes in line to get a table for breakfast, no one had time to serve us at breakfast, and the food was not very good, we waited in line to check in, we waited in line to check out, the restaurant makes mistakes on the order at lunch. The check out-person told us we could keep our access to the first room while waiting for the suite to get ready, but our key cards stopped working so we had to spend another 30-40 minutes with the check in counter to get access to our luggage which was still in the old room. Finally, after spending $1,200 for a night in their suite we were asked to walk to an ATM to withdraw $2 for stamps so they could send two postcards for us. OK, thanks\n\nIt is evident that the service as a Premier Room customer is low. The service level as a Suite customer is much higher - use Club 55 as much as possible! The service at Club 55 lives up to our expectations and service at other great hotels and Club 55 together with the pool is what gives this hotel 3 out of 5 stars. This was a nice change after the first day. We have stayed at 7 hotels in the past 30 days, and even though the service level increased a lot after booking the suite, this hotel comes in at rank 6 out of 7 hotels (second last).\n\nThe top floor pool is amazing, though. Amazing views from the top! A must see!",

They take a nice pic at the entrance however they charge quiet a bit for hardcopy of the photos. If a digital copy be sent to guest on there email or whatsapp for minimal price or for free it would just be a very nice memorable experience.

The luggage magically came to the room and left the room without us needing to supervise, thanks to the very able luggage staff and the exceptional operational management. It is worth staying in the suites for this premiere experience. Each dining option offered by the hotel is just fabulous, with the stunning views from Club 55, the beautifully crafted cakes and savouries at Renku, and especially the widespread and delicious breakfast selections at Rise. The ease with which the scale of operation at breakfast at Rise is managed is just remarkable. The swimming pool experience was also memorable, and we managed to go at times when the crowds were a little less. The suite itself was beautifully appointed, with all necessities placed in the correct position. The views were stunning..we were lucky to get a corner room for an Orchid suite, which offered both city and garden views with sunset and sunrise views. The large windows with mechanised curtains truly elevate the experience. The bathroom and all its amenities, including the selection of toiletries, was extremely premiere. And it is extremely easy to access the towers, the mall, and the various dining places due to the logical layout of the whole complex. The only thing thing that needs a bit of improvement is the elevator waiting time when exiting the sky deck. Overall, amazing stay and we will come back.",

Rasapura Masters is the name of this food court at MBS which is managed by the Koufu. This is not the first time we patronize this place and the latest incident really makes me feel pissed off and decided to leave a bad review for them. Firstly, we bought coffee and tea from them, the taste is so bland and diluted. Therefore i return back to the beverage counter asking for more condensed milk to be added. But to my surprise instead of condensed milk sugar was added instead? Is this the correct way to brew and serve a cup of coffee/tea which cost $2.20 to the customer and give substandard quality? We don't mind to pay extra but it is really not worth as hawker centre coffee is even better than them! And the food court executive is standing at the beverage order counter allowing all this to happen? Secondly, we bought ice kacang from the dessert counter and the portion and appearance is totally different from what is display on the signage. I feel cheated as this is not way to do business and it costs $4.30 for this kind of dessert? I approach the staff making the dessert and she rudely told me is like that one, the display is only a photo! Come on shouldn't you make the finished product to be almost the same as display or else this is actually considered as cheating customers. Example if i sell fishball noodles, my signage display is three fishball and some fishcake but the end product i cook out i only put one fishball into the noodles. Is it correct to do so? I don't think so! This foodcourt is simply a disgrace to the customers especially to the tourists and ruined Singapore food and beverages heritage which they represented at MBS...",

Thank you! worth the stay! The staff is very friendly and nice. I ask for a match after 5 mins they delivered it. I like the place because it's just adjacent to the Mall and to the food court which has a cheaper food price. The infinity pool is amazing friendly staff. There is one time I forgot my wallet in the room and we were hungry at the infinity pool we ordered our food and they just charge my room no. and when we check out they just automatically deduct it to our deposit. Perfect place for a proposal facing the garden bay and the flower dome. Thank you, Marina Bay Sands, for the great experience!

It took an eternity and they didn’t have our two rooms anywhere near each other - even in separate towers.  It is also too big to give a feel for any sort of personal touch, but we knew that going in and it was fine.",

The only issue is it would be crowded mostly and You can see a lot of guests clicking pictures and capturing the skyline. It gives one of the best views of the city and they have restaurants like Spago and Lavo right next to the pool which give quite a few and reasonable eating options as compared to the charges of the room.\n\nOverall I would say that the room sizes could be better at the cost that is charged but then again you should be prepared for spending some money if you want to visit and stay in one of the most expensive hotels in one of the most expensive city 😜.

        "review_text": "My trip to Marina Bay Sands was nothing short of spectacular, and I can't wait to share my experience with you. This iconic destination in Singapore is truly a marvel.\n\nFirst off, the architecture is jaw-dropping. The three towering buildings connected by that massive rooftop deck, which includes the famous infinity pool, are a testament to human engineering at its finest. As soon as I arrived, I was in awe of the sheer scale and design of this place.\n\nNow, let's talk about the shopping. The mall inside Marina Bay Sands is a shopper's paradise. You'll find all the high-end brands you can think of, and if you're a fan of luxury shopping, this is the place to be.\n\nBut the real star of the show is the view. From the rooftop deck, you get an unparalleled panoramic view of the Singapore skyline. I recommend going up there during sunset – the sight is simply breathtaking. And don't forget your camera because you'll want to capture every moment.\n\nNow, onto the services. They are top-notch, just as you'd expect from such a renowned destination. The staff is incredibly friendly and always ready to assist with a smile. I felt well taken care of during my entire visit.\n\nFor those planning a visit, here are some tips. Aim to visit in the evening to catch the mesmerizing light show. Check the weather forecast because Singapore can surprise you with sudden rain. And budget accordingly, as Marina Bay Sands offers a plethora of experiences, and you'll want to make the most of your time here.\n\nIn terms of improvements, it's hard to find fault, but perhaps more affordable dining options could make the experience even more accessible to a wider range of visitors.\n\nIn conclusion, Marina Bay Sands is a must-visit destination in Singapore. It combines stunning architecture, world-class shopping, and breathtaking views into an unforgettable experience. So, if you find yourself in Singapore, make sure to put this gem on your itinerary – you won't be disappointed!",

If you can afford to stay it’s a great one I believe, I couldn’t afford so we went in for the deck tour to get the superior view of Singapore from top. Guess it was more than 54 floor and deck is on top floor and went in by a high speed elevator, was not crowded when we went, the cost covers a digital photo and if you need a printed one it’s extra. The view from the deck is stunning and luckily when we went it was not that sunny, so could enjoy the view. The swimming pool is on other side and only residents are allowed and from the deck we can catch a glimpse. Please experience this view if you are in Singapore. Once we were done and got to the reception level we strolled the huge lobby which was decorated well for Christmas and had some snacks at the cafe /bakery there. Taste was awesome and you must try. From the entrance of the hotel where taxi dropped us for the deck tour the gardens by the bay is walkable which is another attraction you should not miss.",

        "review_text": "Something special about this place is that it's an integrated resort notable for transforming Singapore's city skyline, it comprises three 55-storey towers of extravagant hotel rooms and luxury suites with personal butler services. The appearance of the Marina Bay resort is what makes it famous. The three huge towers are home to 2,500 hotel rooms and suites, joined together at the bottom by a seamless lobby area. What makes these three towers so unique, however, is the way that they are joined at the top. The view is just to die for! I think this is a place for me to enjoy and forget about all my problems for a while. Do you need a break? Have it at Marina Bay Sands!!",

It does get busy, especially in the afternoon, but it is open from 6am to 11pm so there are quieter times to visit. NB the pool is not heated and can be chilly!  The pool bartenders are so nice and attentive. I would’ve relaxed here all day but the amazing views of Singapore beckon you.\nThe concierge team also deserve a mention.

The shampoo, conditioner and lotion smelled really nice. They give you a bathrobe and slippers too which was convenient. Everything is very accessible since you’re right in the middle of town. There’s even a MRT station on the bottom floor. I don’t have any complaints! Oh and the pool is so nice! I could’ve laid there all day. You’re definitely paying for it though!",

Had the opportunity to stay at the city view and the garden/ocean view. I love the sea so i would always prefer the latter.  Things to note during the Covid-19 phase. They do not mention this when ur booking the stay but they do inform u at the receptionist that in order to enter the infinity pool either to enjoy it or just walk around, you need to book a slot. Its an hr slot for each time ur book. And its limited. Due to they capped it at only 50-100pax at each slot. My advice is u book it when checking in. If u manage to get a slot, it will be fabulous.  The pool is basically empty due to everyone is spreaded apart. My kids had a good time since there were more space for them to play . ◡̈",

        "review_text": "Definitely an overpriced place, the facility is outdated and the overall management is poorly designed. If you are there for casino and infinity pool this might be the place for you, but if you are there for leisure and holiday (like us), you might be ended up with huge disappointment. The hotel has no walk-in capacity for stay in guests at any bar/lounge, everything need to be booked in advance. We were planned to stay there for 3 nights but couldn’t find a place for a casual drink at any bar/lounge. The staff there was very friendly and managed to help us made a reservation at one of its bar, but there is a dress code which doesn’t allow any guests entry with slippers and shorts. (For god’s sake we just wanted to have a couple of drinks at the bar, who would wear a formal suit on the holiday with the temperature is around 33 degree Celsius)\n\nI gave 2 star only to the staff there, they are very well trained and friendly. Overall a horrible experience. There are plenty of good 5 stars hotel in Singapore which have better facility/service. For the amount of money I have paid, the experience is not even close to expectations. I would never return there.",

If not, you can walk around and eat only. So many famous items inside this mall and also so many tourists especially on weekends. You should come to this place if you come to Singapore. At least you can feel rich if you come inside.",

Think the main attraction here is to be able to use the infinity pool. But we paid $500 for one night to get a high floor and garden view. The rooms are nice, but not worth $500 if you only going to use the rooms. The infinity pool was super nice. Once in a lifetime experience.",

They take pride in their work, and it shows in their attention to detail and the high level of service they provide.\n\nOne of the things that impressed me most about the staff at Marina Bay Sands is the way they explain the various features and amenities of the complex. From the moment you check in, you are given a comprehensive overview of everything the complex has to offer, including information on the various dining options, entertainment venues, and shopping experiences. The staff takes the time to answer any questions you may have, and they do so in a friendly and informative manner.\n\nOverall, Marina Bay Sands is an impressive complex that is well worth a visit.

It took almost half an hour once I got to the front of the line and then I was told my room wasn’t ready and wouldn’t be for “maybe an hour” - this was at 3:30pm. You are paying a grand a night for that room, you would expect your room to be ready by the usual 3pm time. Luckily I asked if we could go up and use the pool until we had our room which they allowed and were nice about but they didn’t offer that up front. The staff are really nice but the hotel seems to have some strange and very strict processes which makes the stay feel really not holiday-yee. We loved the pool and staff but Otherwise the feel of the place wasn’t enjoyable. We hoped the experience for the price would be better!!\nMust say they were helpful with storing luggage though!",

The hotel is overpriced and we were not receiving that level of comfort that you could receive in any of 5* hotels near by. The room equipment was very weak and old, the free mini bar looked like a joke when you are paying 700$ per night. There were no bath in the bathroom.\nWe had a huge room but it looked empty, they might have added 2 armchairs in front of the window to enjoy the view, but it was not there.\nIt looked like very simple things were missing.\nThe hotel is undergoing renovation now and it looks like it will be even more expensive.",

The room key card is also required to access the infinity pool on the roof, which also allocates you a towel.\n\nThe pool is amazing. It is warm and has the most amazing views across the river to Singapore, including the Merlion. The food is amazing. You can sit around the pool with anything from squid sushi rolls to burger and fries (both of which are delicious).\n\nWhilst the pool is only open to hotel guests the observation deck is open to the public.\n\nThere is nothing to dislike about this experience.

However, you should be prepared for the fact that it can also be quite tiring. The sheer size of the complex means there is a lot of ground to cover, and the lack of available seating areas can make it difficult to take a break and rest tired feet. Despite this, the experience of Marina Bay Sands is well worth it, as long you take it slow and are prepared to pace  and to take the time to fully appreciate everything this iconic location has to offer.",

We had a dedicated team- Erica & Mark- assisting us with an early check-in. They even arranged for a little cake as they knew it was one of my son’s birthday and a bottle of wine… probably since I was solo-parenting with 3 kids!\n\nThe kids visited the pool several times even when it was grey & drizzly as the views were really lovely, and we went to many different restaurants throughout our stay which were all lovely, notably Rise, Spago & Lavo.",

They are comfortable too.\nThe room service delivers in less than 30 min at 9 PM. It's tasty.\n\nThere is no alcohol in the mini bar, but everything is free and refills every day.\n\nThe WiFi is very easy to access but not available when you are in your balcony and the windows are closed. Very reliable and fast enough to do everything  you want.\n\nWhen you are on the balcony in a garden room, the road is a bit noisy. But when you close the windows, you can't hear quite nothing.\n\nBetween levels 10th to 20th in the garden side, you'll access twice per night to the gardens by the bay show directly from your room. Very pleasant.\n\nThere is a SMRT station in the mole next to the hotel.\n\nThere is a supermarket in this mole.\n\nWe went 3 or 4 times (morning, afternoon, evening) in the swimming pool and never had to wait: there were always plenty of free spaces.\n\nEasy checkout. (Less than 2 min).\n\nBad points:\n- WiFi not available on balcony\n- road noise on the garden side in the lower levels\n- 1st price wine in the room service which could be better.\n- would love not finding the lights turned on after every room service.",

And while I am glad we did, I likely wouldn’t stay there again honestly.  For the price, the rooms were really pretty average.  The view we had overlooking the Gardens by the Bay was great though as you could watch the Garden light show from your (tiny) balcony.  Bathroom was nice and large with good amenities.  Staff was overall friendly. The crowds definitely didn’t make it feel personal.  And frankly staying here felt almost like work rather than relaxing.  You had to remember to request check-in times and schedule pool times a day in advance (hard to do while traveling). Then each person has to have their own QR code—only available by SMS—for the pool, which was a problem because some in our party didn’t have cellular service to get the code. Luckily the pool staff accepted the room key and my confirmation email (likely helped we went early before it was crowded).  The pool was definitely impressive!!  It was also frustrating because they advertise over 90 restaurants but we didn’t know they all required reservations, even for lunch.  Most of these were in the mall (full of all the fancy stores and nothing in our price range!). We had a lot of trouble finding places to walk into to eat and that was just annoying.  It was also very crowded.  We did not visit the casino. Honestly the best way to describe the hotel is that you’ll feel like you are in a busy Vegas hotel like Caesar’s or the Bellagio.  It felt more like that than a 5 star hotel, especially considering it was likely the most expensive basic room I’ve ever stayed in.\nAgain it was fun to say we stayed there. We don’t regret it. But probably wouldn’t do it again. Just go into knowing to expect waits and crowds and that you are doing it to see one of the coolest pools ever.\n\nI should note that one in my party completed a mid-stay survey from the hotel and got an almost instant follow up call. So they do seem to care about customer service.",

The rooftop bar and swimming pool are also definitely worth a look. However what it has in terms of grandeur we felt it lacks in terms of soul. The main concourse feels like an airport terminal except there is nowhere to sit and relax, have a coffee, and catch up with work or watch the world go by. The restaurants are OK but not great and the mall is very expensive and exclusive. We did like the lounge bar though and the gardens are great. If you really want to see Singapore I would suggest staying somewhere nearer to China town or Little India.",

It is very expensive here.. £250 for 9 beers and a few cocktails but it's a city break in an expensive country so come to expect that.

Morning breakfast area is huge(Rise restaurant), if you get seated on the outskirts, the food goes cold before you sit down and start eating. That’s how much there is to walk.\n3. Some of room utensils are low quality - tooth brush and slippers specifically. The brush easily falls apart and threads get stuck in your teeth. Slippers reek of plastic.\nEverything else is good, worth it.",

Colleague of mine had the same experience staying 7 nights. Staff couldn't believe it. After 3pm checkin whole world aka people stopping over in SGN 1 night go to the pool. It's cramped on the borderline of health and safety and simply not hygenic. You cannot rely on people taking shower after long flight.\nNever again! If you must because of the view, don't do more than 1night. It's not a pleasant stay, 20mins waiting time for breakfast at the restaurant to sit, 60mins room service.

I don’t know who mandated it, but at Raffles I didn’t see staff forced to wear masks - only at Marina Bay Sands. When I see staff wearing masks it makes me feel as if there is a caste system in the country - the poor are forced to “protect” the rich from their “germs”. It’s really gross to weild this kind of power & enforcement upon the people who are unable to defend themselves because they need their jobs. It also makes me think maybe Marina Bay Sands actually has a huge health & sanitation problem - otherwise why such harsh treatment of workers?  If it’s not just MBS, maybe Singapore is the problem. No hotel worker should be forced to wear a mask.  In the future, I’ll avoid travelling to countries where the poor are forced to mask - it’s a human right to breathe fresh air.",

Unlike every other hotel we stayed in on our honeymoon tour of southeast Asia there was no special gift or card awaiting us in our room. Housekeeping did send up a generic box of chocolates later, which was too little too late to impress. It's not a great hotel for a romantic getaway.\n\nWe opted to stay here only because of the rooftop infinity pool, which is only accessible to hotel guests. The pool is impressive, but also crowded, with a menagerie of Asian and European tourists taking glamour shots at the edge.\n\nIf we did the trip again, I would stay at MBS first, instead of last. MBS is adequate but just can't compare to the personalized service we enjoyed in Thailand and Cambodia.",

        "review_text": "My wife and I stayed here for my 35th Birthday. Being basically THE iconic landmark of Singapore, we had high expectations for the stay and ultimately were let down. Although the façade and much of the shopping/main MBS area exudes a 5-star resort feel, the actual rooms are extremely basic. Nothing about our stay was \"5-star\", for what the final bill was, I would expect a lot more in terms of room amenities, bed quality, overall service, resort perks, etc. Honestly at the end of the day, I just felt like another number in the que. The 57th floor pool is nice for the view only, after that wears off there really is no substance at all. The menu you can order from is tiny (even though there are 3 restaurants up there, you can't order from them....what), the water is seriously frigid, and the drink menu is lacking. There is really no atmosphere at all up there either, from music to theme, to....anything. You just look at the view and pay  for overpriced drinks and food until you've had enough. The good thing is, there is plenty of options for F&B in the area, so no matter what you are looking for you are bound to find it.\n\nOverall I would not recommend staying here, for what they charge and what you get, it really not worth it. There are several extremely nice hotels/stays in Singapore very much more worth you stay than here.",

Would I stay their again knowing what I know now about the resort? Yes.\n\nWe had a Deluxe King Sky View. It had great views of the city and skyline. The only reason we stayed at the hot was for access to the roof top infinity pool. It it wasn’t for the pool I would not stay at the hotel. It doesn’t feel like you are staying in a hotel. It feels like you are staying in a mall. The hotel is big and impersonal.\n\nThe pool is great. Amazing views of the city. However, my wife and I were wanting to have a drink in the pool and watch the sun set. Sounds great doesn’t it. But the pool area does not have an adult only section or pool. This means that there are always screaming splashing kids around you. Don’t get me wrong, I raised two screaming splashing kids. However when you’re paying $1000/night for a room, an adult only section in the pool isn’t too much to ask for.\n\nAdditionally, my wife loves to have a bath before bed and the deluxe rooms only have showers.\n\nWI-FI in the rooms was strong. Free waters and sodas in the room were a nice touch. Also the free ice cream at the pool.\n\nWe signed up for the Sands reward club and got free breakfast at Spagos and a free happy hour one night.\n\nIf you found my review helpful please let me know by giving me a Thumbs Up.",

There is a small waterbody within the mall which can be travered on a boat they call Sampan. This ride would be just about 250 mts and exorbitantly priced. They charge extra to take you to the eye of the waterfall which doesn't work half the time. So best is just walk those 250 mts gazing at those beautiful stores. Very well connected to the metro.

Once you removed anything from it, it will be automatically charge to your room (ridiculous!) and you have to pay SGD10 for another personal mini-fridge if you want to keep stuff in the fridge.\n\nOverall a very nice experience staying here and looking forward to be back again.",

        "review_text": "Fantastic experience! Highly recommended!\n\nThis was our second stay in MBS, however, I couldn't post a review previously as we had to cut our stay short due to my baby falling sick.\n\nThis time, we had a staycation for 4D3N during CNY2022 and it's lovely experience.\nThe moment you enter hotel premises, you're made to feel why MBS is worth the hype and more!\nCheck-in process was smooth despite the large crowd & the staff members ensured everyone is well attended to. We proceeded to our room and the luggage arrived soon after.\nRoom size was good enough. Very clean and pleasant with a beautiful view from the balcony. All the amenities are high quality and well maintained. Loved the bathroom :)\nServices are pretty quick and the concierge/room service respond to calls in almost no time. Very impressive, considering the hotel was almost full capacity.\nI was overjoyed to see plenty of options in breakfast for my dietary requirements (vegetarian, allergic to eggs) and they're delicious! The breakfast place is very well maintained with nice & warm staffs. They're very helpful in adjusting to my baby's mood who went bit noisy & started dropping cutlery at one point. Thanks for that and apologies for the inconvenience.\nIn-room dining service is bit expensive but quality is good with adequate portions. They serve within the stipulated time. No delays.\nWe also explored the infinity pool and observation deck, and both are totally worth the praise. We've been to observation deck couple of times earlier as well, however, infinity pool was just second time as it's limited only for hotel guests.\nWe can't wait enough to book another staycation with MBS as it never ceases to amaze us with its grandeur and services which is world class.\nKudos to the team! You're doing a wonderful job!!",

It was so unlike before covid times where I remembered I waited so so so long before I could check-in & the crowd was horrible.\n\nBooking for pool session was easy too. Just follow the instructions in the email sent prior to checking in. We enjoyed full 1.25 hour of swim & life guards on duty will prompt you 10 min before session ends. So make sure you are on time. No crying kids cos all had to clear for next session guests to enter.\n\nBreakfast at Level 57 was lovely too. Wait for a table through the staff, orders came really fast & food was nicely presented. Yummy too.\n\nNeedless to mention, check out was fast too. Just drop the key cards and that’s all. Wonderful staycation experience. 👍🏻",
