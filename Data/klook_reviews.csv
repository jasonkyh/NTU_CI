PAN *******,Deluxe King · 2 Adults · 1 Nights,5.0,/5.0,Fantastic,Reviewed: 22 Nov 2024,"金沙酒店整體服務.氛圍.精緻度很高.打車至飯店門口就有工作人員來接手行李取走並寫紀錄卡
CHECK IN或提早寫信可以請櫃檯特殊需求.例如吸菸房

缺點就是...太寬廣好容易迷路.整體讚啦

運氣很好當晚在晚上至頂樓無邊際泳池玩耍時看到金秀賢與工作人員來回路過"
Klook会員,Deluxe Twin · 2 Adults · 1 Nights,5.0,/5.0,Fantastic,Reviewed: 22 Oct 2024,2シングルベッドの部屋を900SDGほどで予約しました。レセプションの女性スタッフに話を聞くと予約した部屋は低層階で景色もそんなに良くないとのことで追加で500SDGほど支払いアップグレードしました。すぐに清掃を手配してくれて、まだ午前11時だったのに手続きの10分後くらいに部屋に入れてもらえました。結果的にアップグレードして大正解でハーバービューの海がきれいに見えるし、夜にはガーデンズバイザベイのガーデンズラプソディもしっかり見れました。部屋も本当に素敵な部屋でTWGティーやコーヒー、置いてあるりんごも甘くて美味しかったです。旅行の最終日に一泊だけですが、最高の時間を過ごせました。

Kaithleen ********,Deluxe King · 2 Adults · 1 Nights,1.0,/5.0,Below average,Reviewed: 23 Jan 2024,"We used the infinity pool around 9pm and my skin went itchy maybe because the water is dirty.

The hotel service is very, very good, and I can speak English. If you have any questions, please ask the service staff for assistance. You will receive enthusiastic feedback. I will definitely stay there again if I have the opportunity; the nearby low There are almost no cheap restaurants. If you have a limited budget, it is recommended to order room service meals. It is a little cheaper than Jumbo Seafood."

the cleanliness of the room quite not so clean because we seen a jacket and receipt that I think from the previous guest who also stayed in our room. But it's okay maybe the cleaner also haven't seen because its stuck in the curtain.

Klook User,Deluxe King · 2 Adults · 1 Nights,5.0,/5,Fantastic,Reviewed: 25 Jun 2023,"The infinity pool was incredible! We got lucky with the weather and got to experience a fiery sunset which was the cherry on top. We got the Garden view room which was beautiful but nothing special. Didn’t feel luxurious enough for the nightly rate but I guess you really just pay for the exclusive, pool experience."
이 **,Deluxe King · 2 Adults · 1 Nights,5.0,/5,Fantastic,Reviewed: 25 Jun 2023,"As expected of the best hotel, everything was satisfactory, but there was no sign at the time of reservation, but I was embarrassed to ask for a deposit payment"

Klook User,Deluxe King · 2 Adults · 1 Nights,3.5,/5,Good,Reviewed: 12 May 2023,"I can only say that this hotel can only survive by relying on the building and the swimming pool on the top floor. The room facilities are outdated and aging, just like a five-star hotel in the 1990s. There is no bathtub, and the service is not felt at all. It takes a long time to order food from the room. The swimming pool is really bad The building is very tall and the scenery outside the window is not bad. It&#39;s a hotel that doesn&#39;t live up to its name. I can only say that it feels like a hotel that is run arrogantly because it is a landmark."
曹 **,Deluxe King · 2 Adults · 1 Nights,5.0,/5,Fantastic,Reviewed: 6 May 2023,"There are almost no disadvantages, but the price is too expensive. Another thing is that the location of the MRT is not clearly marked. It is actually very fast to get to the hotel, but we made a big circle"
Marisol *****,Deluxe King Garden View · 2 Adults · 1 Nights,5.0,/5,Fantastic,Reviewed: 21 Apr 2023,"The best hotel we have ever been to, we live in Vegas and stay at the most hotels and the MarinaBay won hands down.

We wanted to get a room with a bathtub but they were full, so the staff simply assigned us a bigger room at a higher floor and that was already enough to excite him!

We also dined at Spago, Rise as well as Bread Street Kitchen. All great... The only set back was Klook sent my last name wrongly and Hotel said they were unable to edit or change and I had to 'live' with the wrong last name throughout the period of my staycation."

Overall nice stay in MBS.

Klook User,,5.0,/5,Fantastic,Reviewed: 20 Oct 2021,Room very nice but check in time is a bit hassle because too many people check in at the same time.
Klook User,,5.0,/5,Fantastic,Reviewed: 15 Oct 2021,Happy with the deal that we bought in KLOOK. Got room upgrade and good service from all the hotel staff. Perfect staycation to celebrate my husband's birthday.
Klook User,,5.0,/5,Fantastic,Reviewed: 15 Oct 2021,"MBS staff are very helpful and friendly at front desk and pool, gym all. Though you need to report your room number and name when you enter and also leave the lifts. Klook package is worth it."

Klook User,,1.0,/5,Below average,Reviewed: 29 Sep 2021,"Customer service at marina bay sands was horrible beyond words. I was double charged for my stay and the room charges, and the hotel's customer service has refused to be of any assistance despite my attempts to reach out to them. Instead, was told to go deal with the problem on my own. Would not ever recommend."
Klook User,,5.0,/5,Fantastic,Reviewed: 26 Sep 2021,Awesome and wonderful experience. We enjoyed a lot. Guaranteed 40 + floor room is good.
Klook User,,5.0,/5,Fantastic,Reviewed: 19 Sep 2021,"Excellent experience here, breathtaking view with sumptuous foods. The city view from our room is spectacular. We like the breakfast at Spago. The infinity pool is definitely catch our eyes."
Klook User,,1.0,/5,Below average,Reviewed: 15 Sep 2021,"Extremely horrible experience.

I purchased a 2 nights stay voucher in MBS from Klook a few weeks back. I called to confirm the details on last weekend before the actual booking day on this Monday. Then Klook staff informed me that the price I pay was for 1 night stay, even though every step for the purchase showed it's a 2 night stay  including the voucher itself. The screenshots are upload in this post. 

After spent a lot of effort, I managed to get a call from Klook 5 days ago (11th Sep) and said they will fix the description in the app and either honer the deal or refund me. They claim there will be a email send to me within 48 hours which is not ture. 

A few things make me feel this is too much for a online platform to treat their customer this way. 
1) No conclusion was given to me after 6 days, and it already passed the actual booking day. 
2) They can fix their app in 1 day, but cloud not send an email to me with conclusion. 
3) They like to blame the customer before they validate from their end. 

Hope everyone don't get the same treatment from Klook as me."
Klook User,,5.0,/5,Fantastic,Reviewed: 12 Sep 2021,"As expected from a good hotel, the service was impeccable and they have a good system to manage the check-in and booking of the pool."
Klook User,,5.0,/5,Fantastic,Reviewed: 4 Sep 2021,I am very satisfied with the newlywed staycation. Thank you klook for its excellent service and service attitude. I thought I was wrong and blamed myself. But klook and Jinsha are full of sincerity and hope to get better and better

Klook User,,5.0,/5,Fantastic,Reviewed: 19 Aug 2021,"great view, great hospitality, nice and clean room & bathroom. not to mention the popular infinity pool!"
Klook User,,5.0,/5,Fantastic,Reviewed: 14 Aug 2021,"Really enjoyed this staycation with my family, the service was excellent and the facilities were great! Had to book the infinity pool and gym time slots in advance. I like that the promotion is inclusive of breakfast, it makes booking on klook very worth it. The sustainability tour was interesting and we were treated to a nice drink and some food too! Hope to be back here again in the future :)"
Klook User,,4.0,/5,Great,Reviewed: 1 Aug 2021,Large room with a great view of the city skyline. Had a good breakfast spread in the room. Downside is the need to book separate the gym and pool using sms. Pool timing is hard to book and we took the midnight slot. But there were fewer people so you literally have the whole pool to yourself. Gym booking will put you in a queue and you will be notified on mobile to be at the gym within 15mins. Enjoyed the morning and evening walks around Marina Bay and Gardens by the Bay. Celebrated birthday and MBS gave a generous sized chocolate cake.
Klook User,,5.0,/5,Fantastic,Reviewed: 20 Jul 2021,"amazing experience!!! given its eve of public holiday, the entire experoence was smooth ans guest centric! Spago for evenings and breakfast was great! DB bistro for dinner was out of this world!!!! Mitre D' Johnny and Zaw Hin were great hosts! i guess part of this great experience was the entire gastronomy jounrney and delicacies! no regrets with the sky city view!!

just do note the checkin timing and booking of pool slots is VERY competitive!!!"

Klook User,,4.0,/5,Great,Reviewed: 10 Jul 2021,"Good stay overall. Stayed 2
Nights on weekday so not crowded and smooth checkins 
In & out are tightly tracked. Only can booked once for pool and u can’t amend despite trying to get help from staff
Gym queue system can be more structured. Currently u join queue but don’t know why your turn will come. Breakfast is good. Spago breakfast seems better when we compared it to Rise."
Klook User,,3.0,/5,Good,Reviewed: 9 Jul 2021,Not wow but there are alot of food availabilities on grabfood and foodpanda. Maybe will book a higher tier room next time instead. The bed not that great either.
Klook User,,5.0,/5,Fantastic,Reviewed: 4 Jul 2021,"the room, service, view and the dining credits were awesome. very worth it!

Klook User,,3.0,/5,Good,Reviewed: 29 Jun 2021,"Klook didn't give enough information to the Bay Sands front and it took a long time to check in.

Food quality is great, just a pity there are limited choices at breakfast for refill or add-ons without additional charges. Overall great experience at MBS."
Klook User,,5.0,/5,Fantastic,Reviewed: 28 Jun 2021,wonderful experience! Great service and friendly staff!
Klook User,,5.0,/5,Fantastic,Reviewed: 27 Jun 2021,Very good service. My family enjoyed the stay and views very much. Nice staycation
Klook User,,5.0,/5,Fantastic,Reviewed: 16 Jun 2021,"It was a great stay at Marina Bay Sands, our room was facing Harbour View and Gardens by the Bay. It was a breathtaking view."
Klook User,,2.0,/5,Below average,Reviewed: 18 May 2021,"There was a hiccup when I reach the hotel and they told me my booking is on the next day. 
Quite sure that I did not mess up the date and requested them to do a refund (which they agreed to and the process takes 1.5 month). To update review if the follow-up is complete."
Klook User,,5.0,/5,Fantastic,Reviewed: 15 May 2021,"Had a great time with my family on this staycation, we were served by Caine upon check-in and he was really friendly and helpful :) Had to book the check-in time, infinity pool and gym slots via SMS, but it was a pretty seamless process. I like that we could choose from multiple places for the daily breakfast and the service from the staff was great too. Overall it was a good experience and this package is worth it compared to booking directly from the hotel's website."
Klook User,,5.0,/5,Fantastic,Reviewed: 7 May 2021,"it was a very pleasant experience with MBS, and we were very thankful that they have given us a room with such breathtaking view for our honeymoon stay !!!
will definitely come back!!"
Klook User,,4.0,/5,Great,Reviewed: 7 May 2021,Book with Klook is breezy and in fact better than dealing with the hotel direct
Klook User,,5.0,/5,Fantastic,Reviewed: 5 May 2021,very well package for family staycation with everything inclusive in the price including free carpark and breakfast.
Klook User,,3.0,/5,Good,Reviewed: 22 Apr 2021,"I didn’t notice the sgd100 F&B until now! Why didn’t the hotel staff remind me? How was I to use it?

The stay was great. Staff was generally very helpful but now I am upset with the sgd100 unused and no one re,in’s when I checked in?"
Klook User,,5.0,/5,Fantastic,Reviewed: 14 Apr 2021,"The washroom were good, good view, bed and facilities were good, tv was good. Bar could have been more filled. Rooms were generally clean and ok."
Klook User,,5.0,/5,Fantastic,Reviewed: 12 Apr 2021,"The booking was hassle-free. I called the MBS room reservations to double-confirm my staycation booking. Miss Felicia was very calm and friendly on the other end of the line. The check-in process was very smooth. Miss Xuwei guided and briefed us through our room check-in. We picked the city view room to catch the different views of Marina Bay at different times of the day. We ended off our staycation with the Sustainability and Art Tour - a tour around Marina Bay Sands and the story behind the great architecture and design, guided by the helpful and friendly Miss Azreen. Overall, we enjoyed our staycation at MBS and would like to thank all staffs for keeping our stay safe and giving us a wonderful experience."
Klook User,,5.0,/5,Fantastic,Reviewed: 10 Apr 2021,"I had just missed my queue by 1 minute., but Jerry from MBS came to help me with my check-in immediately. I had booked an early check-in at 9.30am and was pleasantly surprised that my room is already ready for immediate occupation.  I opted to top up S$70+ to upgrade to a Premier room on a higher floor. it was a great recommendation fro Jerry as the room is bigger with an awesome gardens view plus a huge beautiful bathroom that comes with a bathtub. The room was clean, towels were hygienically wrapped, and all the amenities required were there.  it feels like home.  Staff were friendly, always helpful and always accommodating.  I will gladly come back again and recommend it to my friends."
Klook User,,5.0,/5,Fantastic,Reviewed: 9 Apr 2021,"Room with nice view, polite staffs, nice food........"
Klook User,,5.0,/5,Fantastic,Reviewed: 6 Apr 2021,Check-in was a breeze with the hotel providing time slots for you to select a day before you check in. Early check in was also possible as well which was lovely. Staff were polite and helpful. Breakfast was good.
Klook User,,3.0,/5,Good,Reviewed: 5 Apr 2021,"The deluxe room provided in the package was not worth the price (small and nothing outstanding design wise) and I’d recommend to upgrade the room to a premier for an additional $30+/ night (has a bathtub and a bigger toilet at least). 

Pool sessions were booked out in advance so recommend to book early. Can get quite crowded up there as well despite limited slots so go up early if you want to secure good poolside seats. 

Breakfast and check-in/ out services by staff were quite efficient as fuss-free.

Food options around were expensive but good if you want to indulge (Gordon’s restaurant was great). 

Went to the ArtScience museum and walked out to the Esplanade, Citylink Mall and Suntec City when we decided to further explore."
Klook User,,5.0,/5,Fantastic,Reviewed: 3 Apr 2021,"Best staycation ever. Breakfast was superb, view was good (I upgraded my room to one with city view) and redemption of dining credits was easy. Room was in absolute condition. Highly recommended!"
Klook User,,5.0,/5,Fantastic,Reviewed: 31 Mar 2021,"Easy redemption, love the breakfast and $100 dining credit.

We upgrade to premier room by paying $70+ for 2 nights. Awesome view and good service.

MBS is very strict on guests entering premise. All must be registered."
Klook User,,5.0,/5,Fantastic,Reviewed: 30 Mar 2021,Great deal overall! Breakfast options were good with wonderful views all around. Interesting tour as well!
Klook User,,4.0,/5,Great,Reviewed: 24 Mar 2021,It was a refreshing stay. Staff were professional and courteous despite the many covid measures. Room was very clean and we enjoyed  the many complimentary offering. Overall a pleasant stay.
Klook User,,4.0,/5,Great,Reviewed: 21 Mar 2021,Very good staycation experience and activities went around Marina Bay and Garden By The Bay! Caught both the  beautiful Sunrise and Sunset moment! High floor room with amazing view! The Sustainability and Art tour was a great experience should not missed! Special thanks to our freindly guide WeiXuan. 👍😊 S
Klook User,,4.0,/5,Great,Reviewed: 19 Mar 2021,It was our first staycation experience. Everything was smooth sailing from check in to check out. It helps that there was an advance reminder to arrange to book check in slot. The front desk personnel was also knowledgeable in explaining every detail. It was a wonderful and memorable exprience for us.
Subhaan ******,,4.7,/5,Fantastic,Reviewed: 9 May 2020,"Great hotel, amazing place, the pool view is breathtaking. although a bit pricy still worth it."
Erik *******,,4.5,/5,Fantastic,Reviewed: 28 Mar 2020,Comfortable clean room with amazing views with the sky view. Only complaints are check in process took forever and everything was pretty crowded.
Melina ******,,4.5,/5,Fantastic,Reviewed: 21 Mar 2020,"Amazing views and massive rooms, must stay in Singapore,"

Ziggy ****,,5.0,/5,Fantastic,Reviewed: 13 Mar 2020,"Everything went well! Cleaniness was tip top, front desk check in was friendly apart from having to wait for half and hour in the queue but its worth the wait."
Tsz ***,,4.5,/5,Fantastic,Reviewed: 6 Feb 2020,"The night view is super invincible, especially when you see it in the swimming pool. There are many well-known delicacies on the ground. The Merlion is directly opposite, which is really worth it."
Pak ****,,4.5,/5,Fantastic,Reviewed: 10 Jan 2020,"The booked floor is slightly lower, which makes the visual perception slightly discounted, but after going to the swimming pool, the overall is really good, but the price is a bit expensive, you get what you pay for, which is completely understandable~"
Delilah ******,,5.0,/5,Fantastic,Reviewed: 30 Sep 2019,"Its a great hotel with a stunning view. best Singapore view you could ever get up there, room is spacious and comfortable."
Tsz ****,,4.7,/5,Fantastic,Reviewed: 9 Sep 2019,"The price is good value for money. The first time I came here, it was too expensive at first, but later I thought of coming for the first time, it is better to treat myself better. Just set it here, feel it. The price is indeed not cheap, but the feeling it brings is also incomparable to cheap hotels."
Hallie *********,,5.0,/5,Fantastic,Reviewed: 30 Aug 2019,Infinity pool is such an experience. Superb view. Will definitely go back。
Chen ****,,5.0,/5,Fantastic,Reviewed: 3 Jul 2019,"The infinity pool is super recommended! It is indeed a famous hotel in Singapore, the scenery is really super invincible, the infinity pool is really cool, but remember to make an appointment in advance, the overall environment is also very suitable for taking photos and uploading IG~ and you can see Gardens by the Bay in the morning. It&#39;s really great! It&#39;s just a bit expensive, but it doesn&#39;t seem to be a problem with the hotel, it&#39;s my problem..."
Wu *****,,4.7,/5,Fantastic,Reviewed: 22 Jun 2019,"It is worthy of being a five-star hotel. It can be seen that the employees are well trained, very professional and responsible, and solve problems very quickly. The food in the hotel is a bit expensive, there are many foods outside, you can choose outside."
Chen *******,,4.7,/5,Fantastic,Reviewed: 1 May 2019,"Basically, the staff can speak fluent Chinese, which is very convenient. The swimming pool and viewing platform on the top floor are naturally a must. The clocking in and taking photos are very beautiful. It happened to be my birthday when I went. The hotel prepared a small cake for me. Intimate~"
Zhang **,,4.5,/5,Fantastic,Reviewed: 26 Apr 2019,"Although the price is not cheap, it is definitely value for money. The facilities are good. I personally feel that most people who choose this hotel are for the infinity pool of Internet celebrities. I am no exception. I regret not staying for a few more days!"
Dana *******,,4.5,/5,Fantastic,Reviewed: 14 Mar 2019,"Wonderful experience, nice property and amazing staff. recommend."
Zhang ***,,4.7,/5,Fantastic,Reviewed: 2 Mar 2019,"The room scenery and service are very good, after all, it is in the central area, so travel is also very convenient, and the Internet celebrity hotel is not a boast. Food, drink and fun are all available, and I will continue to choose next time."
Tolga *********,,4.2,/5,Great,Reviewed: 2 Mar 2019,"The facilities are great, good swimming pool view, will stay again if comes again."
Tasnim ******,,4.0,/5,Great,Reviewed: 19 Feb 2019,Everything is so good but the infinity pool is always crowded from morning to night. but view still great.
Pharrell *******,,4.5,/5,Fantastic,Reviewed: 2 Oct 2018,"The hotel is great, the pool is amazing, great food options overall its great. However, because its so famous it can be very hard to enjoy the pool as it gets so crowded."
