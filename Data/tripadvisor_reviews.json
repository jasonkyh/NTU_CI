        "review_text": "We had been looking forward to our stay at Marina Bay Sands for a very long time and our expectations were set extremely high. Unfortunately not everything went smoothly from the very beginning. I would not hesitate to call our initial experience a real disaster to the extent that my first impression and evaluation were completely opposite. I was very disappointed and, to be honest, upset.\n\nHowever mistakes can happen in any hotel or company and the most important thing is how the property responds when issues arise. In this case the reaction was absolutely exemplary. Thanks to the incredible care of Mr. Viktor M. and his team with special mention to Shataz H. and her team, room stylist Htet P., the airport transfer driver and the assistant at the airport (my sincere apologies for not remembering all the names) they managed to turn an unpleasant situation into an unforgettable experience and a memory of a lifetime. For this I will be grateful until the end of my life not only for how they faced the problems head on but also for everything they did for us. I feel humbled, grateful and happy that everything eventually turned out more than excellent, although at the same time sad that our twelve day stay in Singapore has already come to an end.\n\nNext time during our fourth visit we were originally planning only a stopover and as I am professionally from the travel industry we wanted to explore more of the iconic hotels Singapore has to offer. However after what Marina Bay Sands has provided us this time I am now seriously considering remaining loyal to Marina Bay Sands and its team for all our future stays in Singapore.\n\nThank you for everything and I very much look forward to any future reunion. I wish the entire team all the best and many more satisfied guests like my wife and me.\n\nNow a few words about the rooms, restaurants, pool and other attractions that Marina Bay Sands operates around the hotel. The rooms are modern, luxurious and above all clean. The room stylists are very well trained, they pay attention to the smallest details and are able to notice tiny things that would never cross my mind. From the restaurants we had the chance to try the newly renovated Lavo which was one hundred percent, Wakuda one hundred percent, Spago one hundred percent and Rise ninety percent only because of occasional chaos during breakfast service. The infinity pool does not really need any introduction and there is nothing to add that has not already been said a million times. For us it is one hundred percent. The attractions in the area such as the ArtScience Museum, The Shoppes, the casino and others were all one hundred percent. The hotel services that we had the chance to try were also one hundred percent. The location is unbeatable. For most tourists Marina Bay Sands is the centerpiece of their exploration of Singapore. The price may seem high at first glance especially when compared with competitors but based on our own experience I must say it is more than reasonable. The value for money is in my opinion very advantageous. Communication is the category that is hardest for me to evaluate because in the beginning it did not work well on several levels. However once the problems started to be addressed it was on such a level that it became a great inspiration for me. Especially thanks to the already mentioned Viktor M. and Shataz H. You did such a great job.",

Its unique architecture, made up of three towers linked at the top by a huge boat-shaped platform, makes it a symbol of the city and one of the most recognizable images in the world.\n\nAs soon as you enter, the main hall impresses with its dimensions. It is a huge, elegant and modern space, full of restaurants of all kinds, cafes and luxury shops. The Mood is vibrant and cosmopolitan, with visitors from all over the world coming both to stay and simply to see the place.\n\nRestaurants and bars with unparalleled panoramic views of Singapore can be found on the upper floors. From there you can see the bay, the skyscrapers of the financial center and nearby attractions such as the Gardens by the Bay or the Cloud Forest. Many visitors recommend taking to the SkyPark Observation Deck to enjoy the sunset or the illuminated city at night.\n\nAnother big attraction is the rooftop infinity pool, exclusive to hotel guests. It is one of the most famous swimming pools in the world as it gives the feeling of being literally swimming over the Singapore skyline. Although not everyone can access it, just seeing it in photos or from outside the building is already impressive.\n\nMarina Bay Sands is not just a hotel: it is a complete leisure complex. Inside is a large luxury shopping mall with international boutiques, a world-class casino, an art and science museum with very interesting exhibitions and even a theater with shows. Everything is connected to Marina Bay and integrates seamlessly with other area attractions, such as the ArtScience Museum, Gardens by the Bay, the Cloud Forest and the Helix Bridge.",

Throughout our stay, her attentiveness and genuine hospitality made us feel truly comfortable and well taken care of.\n\nWhat touched us most were the thoughtful gestures she prepared for my father’s birthday. From singing the birthday song to arranging champagne and cake in the evening, Eunice went above and beyond to create an unforgettable and meaningful celebration for our family.\n\nHer professionalism, warmth, and dedication reflect the highest standards of hospitality, and we deeply appreciate her efforts in making our stay so memorable. Please kindly extend our heartfelt thanks and recognition to Eunice.\n\nWe look forward to returning in the future and hope to see her again.\n\nWith gratitude,\nLiao Family",

        "review_text": "We stayed three days in Singapore and decided to spend the last night at Marina Bay Sands: the experience was truly unique. In fact, this hotel is one of Singapore's iconic attractions, a must for those visiting the city.\nA plus not to be underestimated: access to the Observation Deck is free for hotel guests, offering spectacular views of the city.\n\nI was immediately impressed by the kindness and professionalism of the staff at the entrance, who promptly handled the luggage with great care. The hotel is very large, so check-in procedures can take a while, but again the staff was extremely helpful and courteous. We were offered a room upgrade to a higher floor with spectacular views of the park and, in part, the city. The only condition was to wait about 45 minutes, which we spent pleasantly in the infinity pool area, sipping a welcome cocktail offered by the hotel.\n\nThe room on the 28th floor was really superb: about 50 square meters, with a large terrace, home automation system to manage curtains, lights and more, a spacious bathroom with separate bath and shower, Japanese toilet, and a high quality amenities kit.\nIn particular, I appreciated:\n\nSheets of Frette\nBathrobes and soft towels\nVery comfortable slippers\nWide range of bathroom products\nWell stocked minibar\nTea and coffee making facilities\nStation with liquor and snacks\nLarge television set\nComfortable king size bed\nBright and spacious room\nLarge safe\nWell-organized spaces for suitcases and clothes\nDyson hair dryer\nThe highlight of the hotel is undoubtedly the infinity pool on the 57th floor, which connects the three towers of the building. According to some rankings, it is among the top three infinity pools in the world. The view is breathtaking, and access is reserved exclusively for hotel guests. The area is furnished with lush plants, sun loungers, towels available, and impeccable Service that allows you to order snacks and drinks directly from the sun lounger.\nNear the pool there are also panoramic hot tubs, ideal for relaxing while admiring the Singapore skyline in an exclusive atmosphere.\n\nThere are three main restaurants: Spago, Ce La Vie and Spago Lounge. We had dinner at Spago and were very satisfied.\n\nThe only point that can be improved: breakfast. You can do it in the area adjacent to the infinity pool, chosen by almost all guests. However, I had to do almost an hour in a row, and the breakfast is not buffet style but à la carte, with quite long waiting times. If I had known, I would have opted for the restaurant near the lobby.\n\nIn conclusion, the experience was excellent. I chose this hotel because of the infinity pool, and I can say that it was absolutely worth it. The price is high, but justified by the overall quality of the stay. Highly recommended.",

Xinyi at the reception counter was quick to get through the admin stuff without it feeling rushed and Nina, formerly a physiotherapist, truly helped me work through my tightest muscles and even gave me tips on how I can relieve those aches between massages.

Thank you to Marina Bay Sands and their staff for making our trip memorable.\n\nFirst, the room was immaculate and very thoughtful. The dual sinks were separated so my wife and I have our own space. It is far easier on the plumbing to have dual sinks next to each other. The bed sheets were freshly prepared. We wash and dry our sheets and we know the effort it took to prepare the bed. We had a wonderful sleep.\n\nThe staff was always thinking of how to improve their services. When we ordered two candies, the quick service heard we were checking out and offered luggage service. In addition they delivered the candies in ten minutes because they heard we were going to the airport. Super proactive.\n\nI will make Mariana Bay Sands my go-to-hotel when I visit Singapore. Absolutely memorable experience.",

We had a beautiful room (Sands Premier King Gardens By The Bay View) overlooking the spectacular Gardens by the Bay! We could see comfortably seated on the terrace the light shows of the Garden by the Bay, really beautiful.\n\nThe room was really luxurious, super equipped, comfortable and the view from the balcony was breathtaking! Frette sheets, bathrobes and soft towels, comfortable slippers, lots of bathroom products, minibar, tea and coffee making facilities, liquor station, snacks, huge TV, comfortable king size bed, bright and spacious room, bathtub and shower, super technological toilet, large safe, spaces for luggage and clothes, Dyson hairdryer...\nThe staff was super welcoming, friendly and helpful: really great!!! We had a little problem with the TV, but a technician arrived in 5 minutes to repair it.\nWe told the reception that it was my husband's birthday and that we would appreciate an early check-in and a great view from our room, all requests were met! You also gave us a delicious chocolate cake for her birthday.\n\nThe infinity pool is truly unique!!! It enjoys a panoramic view of the whole city. It is divided into 3 areas, one of which is adults only, there is a bar, many sunbeds and rooms to change, in addition to the staff who takes care of security and assistance in the pool.\n\nAccess to the swimming pool is reserved for hotel guests, free access to the platform with panoramic views is also provided (for outdoors there is paid access).\n\nThank you very much, we hope to return to your hotel soon, maybe for a few more nights...\nAbsolutely recommended!",

From the moment we stepped in, we were overwhelmed with beautiful flowers at the Front Office, setting such a warm and romantic atmosphere.\n\nMichelle Nguyen was the one who welcomed us, and her kindness truly touched our hearts. She noticed my heavy luggage and cared enough to check on me, even offering bath bombs and salts so I could relax after carrying it. That small but thoughtful gesture showed how deeply she cared. On top of that, she surprised us with an upgrade to a higher floor with the most breathtaking view.\n\nEverywhere we went, from housekeeping to the bellboys, we were greeted with warm smiles and genuine care. It made us feel so cherished.",

I would like to specifically thank Eunice Marasigan for the warm welcome and for providing us all the necessary information for our smooth sailing vacation and fun experience to the fullest extent. She always checked in on us making sure that we were being provided by all the things that we needed. She absolutely went above and beyond. As a treat for my wife’s birthday, they brought cakes every day to all the 3 rooms that we booked, plus champagnes on our last night. They also provided a limousine transport to the airport, where MBS’s personnel were already waiting for us to provide assistance for our airline check-ins. Because of our extraordinary experience at MBS, I already put in my bucket lists that one of my birthdays will be celebrated there. If your room comes with premium services, I highly recommend that you request for Eunice as your service provider - she is a true gem to MBS.",

The rooms were spacious, comfortable, and elegant. Our elderly family members and children particularly enjoyed the garden view from the balcony, especially the nightly light shows. We also had a great time at the SkyPark observation deck and the rooftop infinity pool. Our stay included a breakfast buffet, afternoon tea, and aperitifs, all of which we thoroughly enjoyed.\n\nThe staff at Marina Bay Sands provided excellent service. Upon our arrival, we were greeted by the bellhops, Jan and Ian, who helped us with our luggage. Michelle Nguyen from the front desk checked us in smoothly and made sure to accommodate our need for quick rooming due to our little children. We were also welcomed by Eunice Marasigan from MBS Premium Services in our rooms. She was enthusiastic about showing us how to make the most of our stay at MBS. Eunice was incredibly thoughtful and ensured our stay was both memorable and pleasant. When she learned that it was a birthday getaway for me and my family, she surprised us with birthday cakes delivered to our rooms throughout our stay. On our last day, champagne and sweets were delivered to all our rooms as a special touch. It was such a kind and thoughtful gesture.\n\nOur room was kept clean and comfortable throughout our stay by Xiao Xin, our room stylist. We also had DJ, King, and Edgardo from guest services, all of whom were friendly, accommodating, and always ready to assist.\n\nAt checkout, MBS limousine services were provided, and we were greeted and assisted by MBS staff members Dina and Theodore at the airport. This was a lovely surprise, as MBS extended their service all the way until our departure. A big thank you to Eunice Marasigan from MBS Premium Services for coordinating everything and ensuring we had the best possible experience at Marina Bay Sands.\n\nWe’ll definitely be back soon!",

Her service was exquisite and incredibly pleasant. She even gifted us with a song she composed :-).\n\nThe infinity pool is simply stunning. It offers unbeatable views of Singapore at any time of day; but sunset is undoubtedly the\nbest time to enjoy these\nwonderful views of the city.\n\nAs for the food, the brunch buffet is the best we've ever seen. Such an impressive variety of top-quality dishes, it's a shame we couldn't eat more :-)\n\nThe room is incredible. Decorated with exquisite taste, it offered us unbeatable views of both the bay and the Gardens by the Bay.\n\nThe entire hotel is stunning, and its unique design leaves you in awe from the moment you walk in.\n\nBut without a doubt, the best thing about the hotel, and what makes a real difference, is its staff. Polite, pleasant, and always attentive :-)\n\nWe want to thank King from Guest Services for their services and Leslie from Butler for her thoughtfulness; but we especially want to thank Eunice (Premium Services) for all her help and attention, as well as all the thoughtfulness she provided for our entire family. She made this already memorable visit an event that will be hard to forget and one we will always cherish. We can't thank her enough.",

        "review_text": "Our recent stay at Marina Bay Sands was more than just a visit to one of the world’s most iconic hotels it was a case study in world-class hospitality at scale.\nEvery detail was handled with precision and care. A heartfelt thank you to Daniel Whitelaw, Director of F&B, whose leadership was evident in every interaction. Special recognition to Apriel and Jovita from the Premium Services team, who not only received us warmly, upgraded our room and also arranged for a LEGO set to be personally delivered to our son.\nEqually, gratitude to Sathi and Shangkar from Bell Services for their warmth, professionalism with our mountain of luggage.\nFrom the panoramic suite views to the theatre of Mott32 and the magic of the infinity pool, the property speaks for itself. But it’s the people, their judgment, timing, and empathy who elevated our experience from transactional to truly memorable.\n\nGrateful for the experience and more importantly, for the people behind it.",

        "review_text": "This hotel is a landmark due to its unique design.\nAfter numerous trips to Singapore I decided to visit. I went up to one of the rooftop bars. You pay $35 and it gets you up and with a drink.\nWe were right beside the pool area, which was full of people that spend a lot of time looking in the mirror. And it was packed.\nI see deals online where rooms can be grabbed for around $220 on a special deal.\nPersonally I think there are a lot better options elsewhere that are more personal and less hectic",

        "review_text": "Definitely in the first places of the hotels where I have been and you come back with your eyes closed! I booked directly with the hotel asking for a room on the upper floors overlooking Supertree Grove: just fantastic. Every night from the balcony I could enjoy the light and music show... incredible and really exciting.\n\nThe hotel is huge and I try to briefly summarize the pros and cons:\n\nAgainst:\n\nI had booked a room with a balcony, but initially I was given one with no outside seating and a very narrow balcony. I had to wait one night to get the one with sofa and coffee table, so I recommend specifying it clearly in the request.\n\nI arrived very early in the morning and could only have the room at the exact time of check-in (certainly because of the high turnout)\n\nSuperb breakfast, but with queues practically always. In any case, never more than 10/15 minutes.\n\nPros:\n\nThe spectacular infinity pool, where I could relax while waiting for the room.\n\nFree admission to the observatory, reserved for guests, is a must-see plus.\n\nThe rooms: modern, ultra-technological and spotless. I loved the little details, like the neat phone/laptop cables with custom cable ties.\n\nPresence of a bar corner in all rooms (not included, shame because the cost of the room is quite important).\n\nIn summary: this was one of the most beautiful hotels I have ever stayed at. Worth the expense without a doubt and would stay there again I don't remember every detail because it's been a few months and I've made other trips, but it remains without hesitation among my favorite hotels ever.",

Mervyn, I hope your son's knees are going well🦿🙏\n\nExcellent and Faultless is the feedback from Schonel Enterprises Asia Pacific in our review of the facilities and services provided.\n\nOur Premium Room was incredible. The coffee machine even has a leather outfit on it! The Premium Services team surprised us with beautiful flowers and champagne for arrival, and personalised service every step of the way.\n\nThe bedroom was very large, bigger than the average entire accommodation in most resorts. The bed was like being cuddled by a cloud and the sleep was superb.\n\nOrdering room service through our TV was fascinating, and we were completely satisfied by the quality of the food.\n\nWorking with Robby and getting a thorough understanding of the range of services and facilities, in particular the meeting rooms for our bespoke consultancy services was very important.\n\nWe will be returning for our growing business activities with regional clients, and continuing our plans for the regional headquarters in Singapore, as it is one of the best locations globally.\n\nThanks again Robby, see you soon.

The Service is also not good enough, so we were at check-in for more than an hour because of the simple reason that the extra bed had to be in the other room. You also have to wait for a taxi for more than 15 minutes because they arrange their own taxis, which cost taxis for a 10-minute ride cost €46. There is also not even one place in the whole hotel where you can have a drink. The hotel wants to look super luxurious but the whole thing is full of little screaming children. There is nothing to do in the hotel itself anyway. The hotel itself really only consists of a lot of rooms. For restaurants, gym, theater and shops you have to go to the shopping center further down.

        "review_text": "We chose MBS Hotel as we were watching Lord of the Rings at the Sands Theatre. The hotel room itself was quite nice but the rest of the Hotel was a 2 star experience. Checking in and “registering” for breakfast felt like a check in at the airport with roped in queues. Not only do you have to wait for them to verify you as hotel guest with your room card, you have to wait for a print out and for a staff to escort you to your table. We didn’t see any clear signage of halal food at the buffet spread. The lobby has too many people walking about and felt like a shopping mall. The restaurant for breakfast is on the lobby floor with lots of people passing by. The fitness centre was relocated and is now in another building across the road!! You have to walk a long underpass to get to the building across the road or cross the heavy traffic road and then take escalator or lift to the center. Everywhere you have to show that you are a hotel guest as otherwise they will charge you for being on the observation deck and/or visiting the infinity pool area. There is no direct lift in every tower to the pool area which means you have to use transfer lifts or end up traversing the very public lobby in your bathrobe. If you want a quiet exclusive experience, MBS is not the hotel for you.",

        "review_text": "I made a reservation for 2 nights at the renowned 5-star Marina Bay Sands hotel in Singapore. We booked the Sands Premier Room with Garden by the Bay view (Double Queen). We (I, my husband and my daughter) all had the most amazing and incredibly memorable stay at this prestigious hotel. We were absolutely astounded at the room we were taken to, by the Premium Services staff, Robby. Out of our great astonishment, we were told that our room was upgraded to a Sands Bay Suite. It was the best surprise we had received in our lives. We have thoroughly enjoyed the luxurious room that offered mesmerizing views of the GBTB. Every part of the room is beautifully decorated with quality items. The furnishings, linen and towels were very comfortable, the refreshment bar was filled with an array of snacks and beverages. You won't get dehydrated as lots of complimentary bottled water were provided. In addition to all the luxury features of the room, the bathroom amenities were of famous brand and a highlight for my daughter, who appreciated such products she can use. All areas of the hotel staff are super friendly, courteous and helpful. They were genuinely very willing to provide you with excellent services and treated you like special guests. I would like to thank a few teams - the reservations, premium services, sands lifestyle front desk, the rise restaurant, reception counter, the transfer and bell staff, for their remarkable services extended to us. I would highly recommend anyone to stay (at least once) in this magnificent hotel to enjoy a lifetime experience.",

Great food and service but I want to specifically highlight Mark from Premium Services concierge. He was instrumental in setting up a surprise for my wife's birthday including balloons, champagne and a bouquet of flowers (he threw that in on his own!). He communicated often with me regarding birthday plans but also went the extra mile in coordinating dinner reservations as well. One time, he even physically walked to the restaurant (which wasn't directly on MBS premises) to confirm what the seating looked like at a particular time of evening (sometimes the restaurant officially was listed as completely reserved but still had some tables open). The entire concierge services team was fantastic but his efforts warrant a separate highlight. Thank you for an amazing first trip to Singapore!",

Which basically means not far from 3,500 customers! You can imagine breakfast and the world in the common areas, considering the integration into a large shopping center. An almost cultural experience...\n\nBut the management response has been exemplary: proactive, responsive and remarkably effective. Their quick and personalized intervention completely changed the course of our stay, turning a difficult departure into a pleasant moment for the whole family.\n\nFor Western travellers, it may be a good idea to contact management in advance in order to benefit from individualised care – for example, transfer from the airport and personalised Welcoming – to avoid being drowned in the influx of arrivals and to ensure a stay perfectly aligned with the usual expectations of this clientele.\n\nThanks to this attention, we were able to fully enjoy the hotel’s iconic facilities, its unique setting and its exceptional Mood.

Everything is extremely organized and efficient with everybody having a defined role, but really going out of their way to make the experience unforgettably a cut above the rest. I never got to directly think many of the people that touched us when we were there. They were kind to us without any return gratitude.\n\nAellex pulled me out of line for VIP check-in, as I told him I was so embarrassed as to how we were dressed, and he said you just look like a VIP so I’m bringing you back here. Gwen took my daughter to get a complimentary drink, and Anna helped us check-in and relayed a kind story about her relationship with her mom and herself, as she noticed I was travelling alone with my daughter. I won’t ever forget Anna and hope to say thank you again for the relatable story and making our stay the best ever in my life.\n\nExtraordinary customer service, the beautiful room (thank you to Danny, Yan, and Yvan, thank you for every detail and the tour of how the smart switches worked in our room), and the food… we had breakfast at the pool, which was a tremendous opportunity because of the short timeframe we had… And we had a beautiful 50th birthday dinner at Ce La Vi.

This meant the usual stunning views were not available, which was a little disappointing. Nevertheless, the overall service and professionalism more than made up for it, and I would still highly recommend it once the renovations are complete.

He was in constant communication with our driver and immediately notified him when we were ready for our pick up. Our driver was friendly and talkative and had a lot of knowledge on Singapore. Once we arrived, Robby greeted us at the front of the hotel and took us straight to our room for an in room check in. The bell service team were also extremely prompt with bringing our luggage to the room and were very friendly. Not only did Robby give us a personal tour of our suite (complimentary upgrade) but also surprised our family with free buffet breakfast, afternoon tea and aperitif hour each day of our stay. He also surprised our family with free tickets to a balloon exhibition that was happening at the Expo centre. He was very kind, welcoming and knowledgeable about Marina Bay Sands and all the services the hotel had to offer. He also helped us organise dinner reservations and organised a birthday cake and champagne in our room upon our arrival.\n\nOur entire experience at Marina Bay Sands and interaction with every staff member was memorable, exceptional and exceeded our expectations. We are so very grateful for the experience we had and the attention to detail shown. We will 100% be back and would recommend anyone to stay at Marina Bay Sands.",

The staff were incredibly professional and welcoming upon check in. We received an incredible and kind upgrade and were blown away by how special they made our stay (along with a little surprise dessert). The staff at the gym, breakfast (which had great variety and was yummy), check out, pool and luggage storage were also amazing. The only thing we were frustrated by was that males were not permitted in to breakfast wearing a singlet. After waiting in the queue for 20 mins, this was not mentioned until we were at the front of the line. We don’t have an issue with this rule, however there were no signs or information given about this and we felt it was inconsistently enforced as hotel slippers were worn at breakfast by multiple guests, despite these also not being permitted. Nonetheless, we would happily recommend this hotel and look forward to staying again.",

        "review_text": "My stay at Marina Bay Sands turned into a nightmare due to a terrifying lift malfunction in Tower 2. While using the Paiza lift to the 55th floor, the lift suddenly plummeted in a free-fall between the 42nd and 55th floors. My heart was pounding, and I barely had time to grab the railing while mashing the emergency button and every floor below. The lift finally jerked to a stop at the 47th floor, where I stumbled out, visibly shaken. Another guest sitting outside heard the loud bangs from the lift and asked if I was okay—even he was alarmed.\n\nA staff member escorted me upstairs, where Senior Service Manager Ella Barrientos spoke to me. When I said I needed urgent medical help, she downplayed the incident and told me to wait 1-3 hours for a the hotel to get a doctor from raffles hospital to come over. When I demanded an ambulance, she\ndiscouraged it, pushing their MBS limo service instead—another 30-minute delay. It was clear they didn’t want an ambulance report documenting the incident.\n\nUnacceptable Failures:\n1. No Emergency Priority – They denied me immediate medical care, downplaying a life-threatening malfunction.\n2. No Follow-Up or Support – Not a single staff member came to the hospital to check on me. No calls, no updates— total abandonment.\n3. Zero Accountability – The staff acted like this was a minor inconvenience, not a safety failure that could have killed me.\n\nThis was not just an accident—it was gross negligence. Marina Bay Sands failed at every level: emergency response, guest care, and basic human decency. Never again. If you value your safety and well-being, avoid this hotel at all costs.\n\n★☆☆☆☆ (1/5) – Reckless, Uncaring, and Dangerous",

Crazy in a palace! We didn’t even imagine it.\nThey hastily proposed us to land on the benches of the pool that could serve fries again!\nWell, here's buttocks soaked after a bowl of fries on the pretty evening dress we went back to our room unhappy\nIf the clientele is exclusively Asian , at the price of the room no Service in the restaurant in the evening or for Europeans the evening begins it is really not great!\nThe staff is extremely kind, polite.\nThe pool remains to be seen once in a lifetime but be careful not to imagine being alone!",

Although the price is quite high (CDN$1,225), I loved my experience.\n\nAs soon as we arrived by taxi, the staff immediately took care of us. I was supposed to have a room overlooking the gardens, but it wasn’t ready yet. So I was offered a room with city views at no extra cost. Just... wow!\n\nWhen I booked directly on the hotel website, I mentioned that I was paying myself this luxury to celebrate my daughter’s 18th birthday and 40th birthday. After a first swim, we returned to the room, and a party cake had been dropped off for my daughter. What a beautiful attention!\n\nThe room was exceptionally clean. The bathroom, perfect. We could have made cocktails so well thought out.\n\nThe pool? It is simply breathtaking!\n\nThe breakfast buffet (included) was exquisite. I also tried the evening buffet. Personally, I preferred the morning meal, but my daughter preferred dinner. As a result, we were both satisfied.\n\nCertainly, if I ever return to Singapore, I want to come back here — maybe even for more than one night.\n\nThank you to all the staff for this unforgettable experience.",

By the end of the session, I felt completely relaxed and could feel a big difference, especially in my back and shoulders. U can tell Lisa really knows her craft and puts genuine care into her work.\n\nI’d highly recommend her if you’re looking for a massage that not only feels great but also really helps.

The front desk was barely warm, welcoming, or friendly. Very transactional… I get it, you want our money. There is literally nowhere to sit in the lobby area, just a few hard benches.\n\nThe best part of the stay was the room. The amenities were nice (Nespresso machine, Dyson hair dryer, chocolates, TWG tea), the view of the Gardens, and overall comfort was great. Our room attendant was phenomenal, the most friendly and attentive part of the stay. The attention detail was superb. Everything from wrapping up our cords, to placing bookmarks in our books, to noting which teas, chocolates and coffee pods we liked and stocking with extra…. Soo good! I only wish the balcony had a sitting area? Even a stool would be nice.\n\nThe pool area was also quite good. Views couldn’t be beat and the chairs were comfy. Towels and water were plentiful. Again the prices were crazy. $15 for a small bottled beer, $25 for a cocktail that was 4 sips. For that price I would expect a Texas Roadhouse sized goblet. Lifeguard did a great job keeping kids out of the adult area.\n\nI’m not sure if I’d return, service (minus housekeeping) left a lot to be desired for the cost.",

        "review_text": "We stayed 2 nights in July. Oh, wow! Very 5-star. Lots of staff, all very helpful. Freebies in the room - sweets, chocs, slippers, tea/coffee/water, even a customised birthday cake. Super room with a beautiful balcony giving a view over the gardens.\n\nEnormous breakfast buffet, very very fine. \"You need gluten free? Here, come speak with the chef. If we don't already have it he will make it for you.\" Could not fault their helpful attitude.\n\nAnd of course there's that rooftop infinity pool. Which, if anything, is better than the photos make it seem. So chilled to lie by the pool and have drinks and food magically appear.\n\nI forgot the Jazz bar! Every night from 20:30 on the 56th floor, live jazz! So sophisticated. Go!\n\nThe only glitch we had was that check-in seemed to take forever. But that was easily forgiven and forgotten.\n\nYes, it is expensive, but it is definitely worth the expense. We loved it and will definitely go back if we manage to save up.",

Avril, the receptionist, greeted me with a warmth and professionalism that immediately set the tone for the experience — attentive, gracious, and effortlessly welcoming.\n\nBut the real magic began with Crystal, my masseuse. I’ve had my fair share of massages, but this one redefined excellence. Crystal is not just highly skilled — she’s intuitive, precise, and masterful in her technique. Every movement was purposeful, tailored to my needs, and delivered with such finesse that I was completely transported. Truly, the best massage I’ve ever received.\n\nIf you’re looking for a spa experience that’s equal parts luxury and expertise, make sure you ask for Crystal. And thank you, Avril, for making everything feel seamless from start to finish. Can’t wait to return.",

        "review_text": "When we entered the lobby, one of our group remarked, “This feels like an airport.” The check-in queue echoed the experience you might have at Changi Airport — systematic, swiftish , but not particularly personal. What made all the difference were Simon and Ivy. Their thoughtful professionalism and warm demeanor turned a routine process into a genuinely welcoming start to our stay. Huge thanks to them.\n\nOur rooms were located on the sixth floor of Tower 3, facing Gardens by the Bay. They were fresh, impeccably appointed, and the view toward the gardens left little to be desired. That said, the road-facing side meant some noise filtered in — improved glazing could help future guests sleep a little more soundly.\n\nThe 57th floor houses the famous infinity pool — a marvel of modern architecture and an unforgettable place to unwind. The water was refreshingly cool, the sun generously warm, and the pool bar staff kept service moving with a smile. The poolside menu could use a bit of expansion, but that’s just being particular.\n\nAlso on the 57th are Spago and C‘est la vie, both boasting the same panoramic views you get from the pool. We had breakfast at Spago Lounge one morning and tried the buffet on the first floor the next. Spago was fine — pleasant but unremarkable. The buffet was chaotic. It felt less like breakfast and more like watching herds of buffalo descend on the food stations. There’s plenty of choice, yes, but for a calmer experience, I’d head down to the mall level for artisanal bakeries and quieter cafés.\n\nThe overall experience at Marina Bay Sands remains iconic. Would I return? If they could somehow merge the peaceful, polished atmosphere of the Four Seasons with the drama and grandeur of the infinity pool — absolutely. Finally a big thank you to Madurai, the Bellman who eased our departure to Changi airport.",

        "review_text": "I am a confirmed guest of MBS from 8th July to 11th July, 2025, can provide evidence of my tenancy if required. So check-in is hands down the worst that I have experienced in 25 years of travelling and over 50 countries visited. There were hidden costs - yes hidden until check-in - and a \"delay\" of a security deposit of 1 month!!!! announced at check-in! So they take my deposit and security bond IMMEDIATELY, but refund takes 1 month!!! WTF?\nOkay, let's continue. I was given the the hard sell on all \"features\" and \"functions\" of the MBS. Yep, knew all that before I got there because I have the internet!!! Christ, check-in took 20 minutes because of this sales pitch! I'm not exaggerating, 20 minutes of an up-sell and myself and my daughters were dying for oxygen!!!\nPlease, pull back on the up sell and just let people check in! Your guests generally have travelled for a long time to be at your check-in, just let them get to their room!\n\nSo the facilities are excellent, as you'd expect. Please be aware, like Las Vegas, big hotels = long walking time to anything. The key feature to this hotel is the pool. Just 100% superb, but outside that, you're going to pay the price. I stayed at the MBS for 3 nights, then the Fullerton Hotel for 4 and the Fullerton kills this hotel for value, customer service and quality. Having stayed at the MBS, I will never stay there again, not even if you paid me.\n\nThere's many people who stay one night to access the pool and then rave about 5* quality and how great they are being able to afford such luxury. Spare me. If you've ever stayed in a genuine 5 star hotel, you wouldn't rate this one as close.",

The change between Bali and Singapore and Ritz Carlton Ubud to Marina Bay Sands is immediate. Singapore is truly a beating city life place. Took is about half a day to get accustomed to the electricity of the life in hotel and city. The lobby of the hotel is convenient connector to shops metro , ArtScience museum and the hotel. As such the is a lot of people passing though the hotel lobby. We took advantage of this convenience by visiting the Flower Dome, Cloud Forest, Garden by the Bay, ArtScience museum and the shopping mall. Now the hotel. It is extremely modern and well appointed. We stayed at 34th floor overlooking the Garden. A wonderful view. The room was exquisitely appointed with asian motif furniture. Good size for a family of 3. 2 beds. The complementary breakfasts was top notch. Two restaurants to choose from. Buffet on the libby, or a la carte on 57th floor (adjacent to infinity pool). Both serves great food. The infinity pool has a fantastic view to the city and around. Each person of the party needs to present room key to enter. As luck would have it, our second day was a Saturday where the city was having the fireworks. We got to watch the whole show from our room in comfort. All the staff were courteous and multi lingual. Room service was top notch and very fast.",

No effort to search the agency's emails, nothing. Luckily my card was large because when you stay 20 days on the road you have a lot of expenses. at 11pm in a hotel like this with these costs no one gave you food, Room Service did not even answer the call, it was 11pm not 2am.\nThey arranged the transfer to the airport from the hotel departing at 6.30am and had told the agency that they would provide us with a box with breakfast: absolutely nothing. We were fasted from lunch the day before...... I would say scandalous.\nWhen we left they recognized that the room had already been paid for and then they reversed the charge that still blocked the amount for 15 days.",

        "review_text": "Our family of 2 adults and 2 kids (4 & 10) have just returned from a wonderful 7 nights stay at Marina Bay Sand. The Marina Bay Sands team went over and above to ensure our stay was memorable and amazing. We were treated so kindly by all staff, and we can honestly say that it is our favourite hotel in Singapore. Marina Bay Sands is a destination in itself, and we feel very fortunate to have been able to experience this once in a lifetime destination.\n\nFrom the time that we landed at Changi Airport, we were met by the competent Premium team at arrival to escort us to our waiting vehicle; then when we arrived at the hotel we were again meet by another Premium team member who escorted us straight to our suite for a hassle free in-room check in avoiding the hustle and bustle of the main foyer; and then on our day of departure, Victor Mai, the hotel Manager took the time to personally assist us with a stress free check out. All of this made travelling with kids so easy and stress free.\n\nOur kids have some sensory challenges and special dietary needs which made breakfast at the Rise restaurant a particularly stressful time – once Victor was made aware of this, Victor went over and above to offered solutions for us to have a more peaceful and enjoyable breakfast time as a family. We really appreciate Victor’s understanding and kindness.\n\nThe hotel itself is a beautiful work of architecture and our room, a Family Suite on the 9th floor did not disappoint – we had a spacious balcony offering breathtaking views overlooking Gardens by the Bay, and best of all, we were able to watch the Super Tree Light Shows each night from there which was just a magical experience.\n\nOur Family Suite was well designed with family in mind – so spacious and impeccably cleaned; and with all the amenities a small family would need, best of all we loved the washer/dryer which came in handy when travelling with small children and the microwave oven which we used many times for our fresh popcorn. Our kids adored having their very own room which had a bunk bed, bean bags, a huge TV, Nintendo Switch and kid-friendly amenities.\n\nWe would like to say a special thank you to the following wonderful people at MBS that has made our holiday a truly memorable one.\n\n• Victor Mai (Manager) – thank you for your understanding and kindness around our children’s dietary needs, and for handling our departure with such care. It really means a lot to us.\n• Sid (The Club Lounge) – thank you for your kindness and friendship, we really enjoyed getting to know you, you made our little family feel so at home each time we dined at the Club Lounge, we will miss you. Thank you for taking the time to personally check that the kids' meals were always prepared to their special dietary requirements.\n• Jian Dang (Room Stylist) – thank you for your hard work in keeping our suite impeccably clean and well stocked and we appreciate your thoughtfulness in ensuring that the kids always had plenty of their favourite popcorn available.\n• Angel (Premium Services) – thank you for your help with our special room service request when were out one day, your care in keeping us informed along the way which gave us peace of mind.\n• The Pool Team – your friendliness and beautiful smiles always made us feel so welcomed each time we visited the infinity pool. Thank you for all your hard work in ensuring that we always have enough towels and refreshments and for keeping everyone safe.\n• Raymond (Bellman) – thank you for helping us with our many pieces of luggage, your dedication and care is really appreciated.\n\nWe highly recommend the Marina Bay Sands especially if you are travelling with little kids as the Family Suite is awesome and has everything you would need; the location is perfect as there are so many dining options at the hotel and the shopping mall; lots of kid friendly attractions right at your door; taxis are always readily available without having to wait long; and the helpful, friendly MBS team are always on hand to help make your stay as stress free as possible.\n\nWe look forward to visiting again soon.",

        "review_text": "We recently stayed two nights at Marina Bay Sands’ newly renovated Paiza Suite to celebrate our anniversary and my wife's recovery—and we were truly amazed. Having stayed before the renovations, we didn’t expect much, but this visit completely changed our impression.\n\nThe suite was incredibly spacious with a gorgeous skyline view, karaoke room, fully equipped kitchen, and thoughtful in-room amenities (yes, even a pillow menu!). The attention to detail was superb.\n\nThe real highlight? Paiza Butler Service. Huge thanks to Ben and Vicky, who went above and beyond anticipating our needs—even noticing small things like when we needed a plastic bag or misplaced our key. Check-in and checkout were seamless.\n\nSky Residence, the exclusive lounge for Paiza guests, was another standout—amazing food all day with rotating menus. Special thanks to Mr. Sara and Ms. Joppy for their warmth and impeccable service. I may have gained 5 lbs in 2 days, but it was worth every bite.\n\nAlso shoutout to Laura and Sun at the infinity pool who added to the magic with their smiles and stunning photos.\n\nThis was more than a luxury hotel stay—it was a world-class experience. Can’t wait to return!",

        "review_text": "Marina Bay Sands is indeed unique in the world. The three towers alone, the huge lobby, but also the pool in the 56th floor. Stock are more than breathtaking and leave nothing to be desired. A detour to Garden by the Bay or the harbour front is an absolute \"MUST\".\nHowever, those guests who book a not exactly affordable suite as part of the \"Sands Collection\" are very disappointed. If regular guests have been used to enjoying the unique advantages of the \"Club 55\" in the course of the suite booking in recent years, they will be clearly disappointed. The \"Club 55\" is now forbidden to these suite bookers, only small pre-made snacks and 1 (!) Drink offered. And this offer can be found again in a location in the lobby, which at best exudes the charm of a bad train station pub.\nUnfortunately, the management changed: If you want to enjoy full enjoyment as part of a suite booking, you must choose the \"Paiza Collection\".\n\nMarina Bay Sands: Unfortunately, you lost a regular customer.",

When we were at the pool, Ravi served us, explained everything about breakfast, answered all our questions, gave us directions on which places to visit in the city, which season is suitable, I liked the offer for the new year and the fireworks.I never thought I would be so impressed by the hotel, the service and the staff, the food was extremely delicious, diverse, I have never seen such a choice anywhere and I hope to come back again for a longer stay one day.",

For a hotel of this size, with so many facilities and rooms, our stay had been most impressive to say the least! Not only was the room very clean for our entire stay, the housekeeping team was polite, warm and friendly. MBS is a busy hotel with many people on its premises all the time. Yet, we quite like the lively vibe of the hotel, especially since it was the festive season. Would definitely recommend the view and chillax time at the infinity pool deck, and also seeing Singapore at night from the Skypark Observation Deck. A stay at MBS is definitely worth the splurge!",

        "review_text": "We recently stayed in one of the suites. A truly breathtaking experience for the family. Whilst I do not usually take to social media platforms to do reviews, MBS is truly deserving of this!\n\nService - Top-notch and highly impressive - having stayed in suites around the world prior to this, the butler team has taken hospitality to a different level - if I must use only a short phrase to describe this - world-class! Thank you very much to the butler team especially to Lesley ( Senior butler, who started reaching out to us via email ahead of our stay),Thana ( our butler for day 1) , Charlotte ( day 2) and Ruth ( day 3) . Whilst words cannot describe our appreciation to this stellar team, including the staff in the Sky restaurant ( the manager on the ground on 17th June who attended to us during brunch and also the team attending to us at the table including Vella and her 2 colleagues ), not forgetting Edx, who helped us with the luggage at checkout - thank you for going above and beyond for us during our short stay!\n\nThe hotel and hospitality industry is only made possible and can only climb to greater heights ( pun not intended) because of their members of staff who are the faces of the hotel. I do hope the hotel management continues to institute measures and retain their excellent teams with the needful incentives and commendations at appropriate junctures. This will continue to encourage their teams to strive and maintain excellent standards.\n\nRooms- Spectacular view of the city skyline!\n\nFood - Sky Restaurant and Spago - Wide and impressive variety at the Sky Restaurant. Well curated and a good range of cuisine with quality ingredients and drinks. If one were to be hungry in the night, Spago will not disappoint!",

You could really tell that every detail was well thought out. The service was absolutely top class, with staff who were both professional and incredibly friendly.\n\nRoom service was on point – fast, smooth and with great food. The breakfast really gave everything you could want – an abundance of options, high quality and something for every taste.\n\nThe highlight was of course the infinity pool. Swimming up there with the iconic views of Singapore was an experience in itself. We ate club sandwiches and drank mocktails by the poolside – it felt like a scene from a movie.\n\nWe ended the night in the casino, which really delivered!

Cocktail hour has also been abolished, becoming aperitif hour, and reservations must be made at six restaurants. Popular stores are full of reservations. It's not a buffet like before, just one plate and a drink. Seating is only available for an hour. I paid extra to drink champagne, but it was only an hour, so it was very hectic.

Afternoon tea has changed from a club to a rise, and it's a very small space, with coffee being an automatic machine. Cocktail hour has also been changed to aperitif hour and you have to make reservations at six restaurants. The popular wakda was full of reservations. And only a set plate and a drink (no champagne, sparkling wine) and only an hour's seating. It used to be two hours in a spacious space and you could have all you wanted. It has changed so much, it is so disappointing. It was a suite stay with no special feeling whatsoever.",

Also very happy with room design ( thoughtfully laid out) though being on 3rd floor, balcony is noisy and showed road view rather than any garden by the bay view. For the price (over $32k), I would expect a quiet balcony with magnificent views.\n\nStaff service is a mixed of helpful and indifferent. Not impressed by front desk and concierge, while Housekeeping is great, as are in-room dining, gift shop staff and limo service. Special mention of spa team -Yaneli , Lisa and Enita who provided excellent and friendly treatment. Also sky deck activities such as yoga and sound meditation were great though 2 classes were cancelled last minute due to lack of alternative arrangement during inclement weather.\n\nStay marred by drinking glass breaking in my 3 year old grandson's mouth in Rise restaurant during breakfast, staff were quick to act though.\nIn addition, the stay did not end on a happy note as my departure was held back by an unjustified demand for extra charge ( breakfast for the little ones).\n\nNevertheless overall experience is good.",

From the time we arrived at the hotel to be greeted by our personal check in host to the time to leave with the same service, I'm sure this must be the best hotel in Singapore...don't think about it book in!!",

Upon arrival, I was warmly assisted by staff who efficiently handled my luggage and facilitated a seamless check-in process. My room offered breathtaking views of Marina Bay and was conveniently located near major attractions, dining, and shopping, all accessible on foot. I also enjoyed additional access to the infinity pool and restaurants at the summit of the Marina. Having stayed in several hotels in Singapore, none have matched the unparalleled luxury of Marina Bay Sands.",

        "review_text": "Easily the best experience my family have had whilst on holiday! A new bench mark has been set!!! I would give Marina Bay Sands 10 stars if I could. Everything was just perfect. The team members at check in were lovely and made everything so easy. My luck with rooms is terrible, it doesn't matter what I pay I get the car park view. Not this time with no special request from us, we received a beautiful view of the gardens by the bay and could watch the light show every night. We even received a personal guide on arrival and departure that helped us settle in and get on our way which was amazing when travelling with a newborn and a 4 year old. The room has all the amenities you could ever need, drinks for the adults to snacks for the kiddies. So much thought has been put into all the little things you may need as a family on holiday, felt like we had more than we needed and all those things we forget they had. All the staff were fantastic and the food was incredible. Breakfast buffet had plenty to choose from and the dinner buffet was the best my wife and I have ever experienced. There is nothing I can fault and you won't be disappointed if you stay. No need to even bring any toiletries or a pool towel, the quality from toothbrush to the staff waiting at the pool with a towel and water bottle were just superb. We will definitely be back.",

        "review_text": "So the lobby is nice, and swimming pool also, but if you are looking for a nice room, stay away. We had a room with two beds, and one ONE power outlet that was worn out and we had to use multiple adaptors (which we fortunately had) to get things to stay in without falling out, and plug in two chargers. We shared one bed, while our child use the other. Which meant even with our adaptors, the person on the outside cannot charge their phone.\n\nBut the worse part is the awful polyester bathrobes. I know resorts need to save money, but seriously, they can't afford to supply a cotton bathrobe to their guests when charging 1,300 dollars a night!\n\nThis will be the first and last time I stay here. It has 5 star prices, but the room is more like a 3 star place.",

        "review_text": "First visit to Singapore, and the Marina Bay Sands was the highlight of our trip! What an amazing property! Where do I start:\n\nROOMS - Spacious rooms with a large shower/tub, separate toilet with sink, good sized closet space with drawers and hanging shelves, good quality amenities. Excellent in every way.\n\nSERVICE - Courteous and prompt, whenever we needed to call for anything! Concierge was also helpful in helping us navigate the city.\n\nINFINITY POOL - Rooftop pool is one of the main highlights of this property! Go up early before the sun beats down on the roof - we got there at 6am every day when the pool opens, and it was heavenly right up until sunrise. Or you could go at sunset, but it gets really crowded then.\n\nRESTAURANTS - We had breakfast included at their Spago, the rooftop restaurant, or the one at the Lobby level. The breakfast at Spago was a set menu - we chose the Laksa - outstanding!! The one in the lobby is a buffet, and that had a massive spread as well, but it was very very crowded! I guess folks prefer buffets to set menus?\n\nFITNESS CENTER - Even though the fitness center is a bit of a hike to get to, coz it's in the Casino side of the building, it's a very well equipped gym and totally loves up to the hotel standards. Plenty of strength and cardio machines, all brand new and use the latest tech. Very impressive. If you prefer to run outdoors, there's a great 5k loop around the waterfront by the hotel - the concierge can help with map it (just keep in mind that it's hot and humid almost all the time!).\n\nThe shopping mall at the base of the hotel, as well as the walkway to Gardens by the Bay from the hotel, are both incredible. The mall has plenty of high end stores, and some excellent restaurants / coffee shops. You can never really get bored at this property!\n\nAll in all loved Marina Bay Sands! Will definitely positively stay here again on our next visit to this beautiful country!",

Its the most beautiful hotel we have been. Its huge. They have a lot of restaurants, casino, shopping mall... and much more inside the hotel. Also the infinity pool is only available to the guests staying at the hotel. The stuff super nice, we were able to check in earlier, and also for checkout. They gave us a complimentary late checkout and after we were able to keep our bags at a storage place until we return. The room had a letter welcoming us, super nice suite. Big tip book directly with the hotel. We had a good discount with.",

No matter what tower or floor you are staying on. Man, Ryan, Rina stood out to me in a way that I never wanted to leave the infinity pool area. Man always with a smile and anyway he can help you, always made sure my lounger or cabana was set up just the way I like it. And warned me the temperature of the hot tub 40deg didn't stay in there long to hot for me but great photo's to be taken from there . Rina the lovely lady that makes sure you scan in always smiling ,and just the best way to start your experience up there. Ryan the lifeguard always a little chatty if im in the pool if he's not busy excellent with great photo advice as to where to take the best photo's from. Them alone just make me want another holiday there soon. 5 stars from me.",

However, as a returning guest, I was very pleased to see that the check-out process has been streamlined—you simply drop your key card and any charges are billed directly to your credit card, making departure quick and hassle-free.\n\nUnfortunately, there was a frustrating issue with our room allocation. Despite multiple confirmations prior, the hotel failed to provide the single king bed we had booked. The check-in staff offered us a downgraded room with blocked views—far from the full view with balcony we had reserved—if we wanted the correct bedding arrangement. This was disappointing and not what I would expect from a hotel of this calibre.\n\nThat said, aside from this annoyance, the overall experience was pleasant. It’s always a treat to stay at Marina Bay Sands, especially for access to the iconic infinity pool, which remains a highlight of any visit.",

The room (suite) was fabulous and all of the generous little extras made us feel pampered and like all of our wants and needs had been anticipated and prepared for us in advance. The restaurant buffet experiences were equally fabulous, with a fantastic variety of dishes from many different cultures and an abundance of choices. We had planned to do some sightseeing in Singapore during our stay, but the resort itself had so much to offer in terms of great experiences that we never left the resort campus. We were expecially looking forward to the rooftop infinity pool and it was everything we were hoping for. We were expecting it to be crowded, but that was never the case. It was very relaxing and an exceedingly awesome experience! To cap it all off, on our final evening, after a relaxing sunset soak in the pool, we returned to our room to find a complementary tray of smoked salmon, caviar, and chocolate covered strawberries waiting for us, along with a sweet customized message from our personal concierge, Eunice, who had decorated our envelope with a drawing that clearly indicated she had been listening when we shared some of our current travel experience with her. Very touching. We couldn't have been happier with our stay at the Marina Bay Sands and would love to return some day.",

        "review_text": "I'm writing to express our sincere gratitude to Erica and Betty at Marina Bay Sands. My parents, who previously enjoyed a wonderful stay, were initially given a room that didn't meet their expectations. Erica and Betty listened with empathy and immediately took action, going above and beyond to find a more suitable room that was perfect for their comfort. Their personal touch was truly remarkable; they escorted my parents to their new room, ensuring they were settled and happy. This level of care made all the difference and turned a potential disappointment into a fantastic experience.\n\nErica and Betty, thank you so much for your outstanding service and for going the extra mile. Your dedication and genuine care for guests are truly commendable. We will certainly recommend the hotel and look forward to returning, knowing we'll be in such capable hands.",

I was also amazed by the overwhelming architecture I first saw, but Miss April showed me to the family room after check-in, which was even more surprising. I was thrilled with the size, the facilities, the opulence, the very relaxing space. What's more, the children missed Miss April's kind and attentive guidance. I was also very happy with the presents for the children and the facilities in the children's room. Thank you.\nThe whole family was particularly excited about the infinity pool, and my son and others loved it and went there three times. Especially the night pool was amazing and the whole family really enjoyed it. I want to have more and more fun! It is a pool that I think.\nThe hospitality, facilities throughout the hotel and the day and night views from the hotel were definitely memories the whole family will remember for a lifetime and I definitely want to go to Bay Sands again.\nThis is the best hotel I have ever experienced.\nThank you very much.",

From the moment we arrived, everything felt smooth and welcoming. A big shoutout to Ms. Yve who checked us in—she was super friendly and helpful. It was my first time in Singapore, and she gave us great suggestions on where to go and what to check out. You can tell she really knows the place and loves helping guests.\n\nOur room was beautiful, super clean, and had a great view—it definitely added to the whole experience. And of course, the infinity pool was a major highlight. It’s just as stunning in real life as it looks in the pictures. We spent a lot of time up there just relaxing and soaking in the view.\n\nOverall, it was a really special and memorable stay. Everything felt worth it, and we’re already talking about coming back.

        "review_text": "This was our second stay at MBS as a friend was visiting and I wanted to treat her. I left the reservation too late and couldn't get a Paiza suite. However the wonderful lady at check in arranged an upgrade and we got a Seaview suite on the 52nd floor.\n\nThese suites are worth every single penny. Minute details were thought of when designing the suite. Wireless charging on almost every surface, a beautiful vanity to get ready at with a Dyson hairdryer. A room scent to use and take home. A variety of teas that will blow your mind. The shower is phenomenal and the bathroom also has a TV. On top of the two already in the suite! I could fault nothing!! And I'm picky!!!\n\nWe had breakfast at Spago on day 1 which was good. Dining options are not extensive and they will not cook to your needs. Food comes off a line and the chef won't take any changes. I asked for my bacon to be cooked longer as the fat was barely rendered for the table next to us and it was a no from the chef. I ordered an omelet.\n\nCouldn't have breakfast at Rise the next day as the queue was at least an hour long. A kind staff member suggested Origin and Bloom at tower 3 and it was the best decision to have a quick snack there. So so good!\n\nThe infinity pool never disappoints. Multiple closures due to lightning but don't believe other reviewers that it will ruin your stay. There are 2 for 1 cocktails when the pool is closed! It also never lasted more than an hour and we were back in! Do try the jacuzzi as well.\nPoolside snacks are good but limited. I do wish there were more local food options available on the menu.\n\nThere was a very rowdy couple one day at the pool. Fighting with one another and swearing so loudly. The woman even asked that someone call the cops. The staff handled this situation so impeccably well. Bravo!\n\nThe staff at this establishment are the true attractions. Thanks to Mo, James and Charis at the pool for great service and conversations.\n\nWe will always be back!",

The bed was so comfy, the gardens by the bay view was insane! The room facilities were amazing, what did we not have… haha!! This hotel is worth every penny. On our check out the porters DJ & Chris were so attentive and helpful, engaged in a great conversation and wished us safe travels. We had a late flight therefore did not have to leave the hotel until 6pm, however, we were provided temporary passes at a later checkout time at midday so that we could still use the infinity pool. We also were given a room to shower before we left the hotel. The service is beyond remarkable. Thank you Marina Bay Sands!

We pre-checked in, were given pre passes that gives us access to all areas. We had a look around the shopping mall, Little Venice with Gondola had lunch at the food court. We went back at 3.00pm to check in only to be told our room was not ready! Very disappointed, we went to level 57 and enjoyed the views saw the infinity pool that we were hoping to have a late afternoon swim. Room was finally given to us at 4.30 pm, having had to complain, check in reimbursed us $100 to spend at the hotel. The room was immaculate Jo Love toiletries. Bathroom was spacious, our room was good size had state of the art features, garden by the bay view was stunning, we were Tower 2, level 17. City views from infinity pool were stunning, the other side had garden by the bay views. Spargo for breakfast was scrumptious, staff at the restaurant and hotel went above and beyond to keep hotel guest happy. We really enjoyed our two stay at Marina Bay Sands. Would be back one day.

And with the complete set of weights ranging from 1- 50 kilograms, i couldn't be anymore happier since it is easier to do drop sets for me\n\nThe gym aslo has a very complete set of machines from stair masters, treadmills, and suprisingly a punching bag. The gym has very clean machines also, with the benches also with no visible rust or any type of stains on them.The staff regularly walks and patrols around the area to check for any misplaced weights or equipment and places them back to the appropriate spot, and the hospitality of the staff is by far the friendliest i have ever seen. This is by far one of the best hotel gyms i have ever been to.",

        "review_title": "Amazing hotel",
        "review_text": "We were really looking forward to this hotel and I’ve got to say it really didn’t disappoint.\n\nWe stayed in a double queen room facing the gardens and the view was stunning. The room was a great size, with a balcony and a really well equipped bathroom. I think it was probably the nicest hotel room I’ve ever stayed in. Beautifully done in every way, I really can’t see how the rooms could be improved.\n\nThe roof top pool is spectacular, an amazing experience and frankly worth the cost of accommodation.\n\nThe only issues we had were breakfast. We are a family of four and went to the rooftop restaurant the first day and were surprised there was no kids menu. The menu for adults is great but not many 10 year olds want an omelette with whipped feta and wild mushrooms. We asked for something less complex and were told no, the menu is as it is. They didn’t even have an apple juice. The next morning we went to the buffet in the lobby and had to wait over 15 minutes for a table which we hated. The restaurant is in the lobby and it feels quite exposed and queuing for food like that felt really awkward. We returned to the rooftop the next morning as we hated the buffet experience but the service on this third and final day was beyond dreadful. We had struggled to be understood on the first day but managed to at least get a plateful of food, this did not happen on the third day. We waited 20 minutes for coffees that never came, the fried eggs we ordered came delivered as some sort of oily whipped meringue-like mess. Genuinely an awful experience so we left and decided to have breakfast at the airport. It was an awful end to what had otherwise been a great stay.\n\nUpon checkout I queried why we hadn’t received the credit towards our spend in the hotel as this was part of my deal when booking. I was told I had to claim this at a machine. This wasn’t explained at all during check-in and we really wanted to just get checked out as the kids hadn’t eaten. They offered to take me to the machine there and then but this felt awkward and time consuming. I think they should make it clearer upon checking in. It was only a hundred dollars but given we’d run up a bill of thousands of dollars in 3 days it seemed a shame to not be able to use it.",

Vikram, the head concierge made several phone calls to get us the reservation we wanted that evening. He just makes everything work and couldn't be nicer!!!

There was no stone left unturned; every need we could have had we instantly addressed. This was an experience like none other we have had.

        "review_text": "We have just returned from an 11 night trip to Singapore and Bali. The first stage of the trip was 4 nights at the Marina Bay Sands, which was definitely the highlight of our whole trip.\n\nAt check-in, the receptionist asked whether our trip was for a special occasion. We explained that it was for a joint 60th birthday plus a retirement, thinking perhaps that we might receive a cake or something. We were instead informed that we would be upgraded from our booked room (\"Premier Garden View\") to a room in their \"Paiza\" floors, which turned out to be a \"Paiza Bay Suite\". This was a fantastic and totally unexpected upgrade - I won't go into details of the room - everything is on the MBS website, but basically it took our stay to a whole new level.\n\nThe Paiza rooms benefit from many perks including butler service, breakfast/brunch, afternoon tea and evening drinks/canapes in the exclusive Sky Lounge on the 55th floor. We made full use of these facilities during our stay and the experience and service were first class.\n\nThe room facilities were excellent and could not be faulted.\n\nOne tiny tip - I did have some trouble connecting to the Chromecast facility on the (huge) TVs in the room, but it turned out that each TV has a little cupboard at the bottom left corner hiding the very useful HDMI input connector so that worked much easier.\n\nOf course the infinity pool is a must-use facility. Unfortunately our stay was rather short so we only used it once but the pool and amazing views across the city were very memorable.\n\nThe hotel is perfectly located for easy access to all the popular attractions and of course has its own MRT station in the attached shopping centre for slightly further trips.",

The refreshed suite offered an elevated level of luxury. The interior was entirely refreshed with new decor and furnishings, plus ambient lighting and a luxurious marble bathtub that provided a warm and relaxing experience.\n\nThe service provided by the MBS staff from the day of arrival was simply exemplary. All the staff, from the Front Office, restaurant to housekeeping, were professional and extremely detail-oriented.\n\nThough my time at the property was short, this recent stay was indeed memorable. I cannot wait to return for a longer stay next time to enjoy Marina Bay Sands, and I highly recommend this hotel for both business and leisure travelers who desire a memorable, top-notch hospitality experience.",

We had an interconnecting room facing Gardens By The Bay (I would recommend). I had one small issue at check-in which I forgot about but it was logged and management (Abdul Rahman Bin Umar) sorted it out proactively. The only niggle is the queue for breakfast can be long (c15-20 minutes) however it is worth the wait - the options/selection on offer is so good! We are back in London and still talk about this one hotel. The big highlight is the pool on the 57th floor - we were there throughout our trip including 11pm in the evening - it was a special highlight.

This is quite a lot of money but we were expecting to be amazed and see so much at the top.\nOh dear.....the poor tourist is confined to a very small potion of the roof space (probably about 1/8th on the left hand side of the photo image on the left. There is a somewhat overpriced minibar up there where a small can of coke is $5 - so we shared one like most people up there, Perhaps given the cost of getting up there a small drink could be included (especially since on a fine day with the sun out there is no shade or cover up there and it is absolutely baking hot.\nOn arrival at floor 56 and stepping out the lift it is 'compulsory' to have your photos taken. When you walk around the other side a member of staff is quickly finding the taken image and sell it to you for another $70SDollars - A right rip-off without asking permission in the first place. Interestingly the roof is arranged that to use the toilets you have to go to the exit. So if you go to the loo on arrival (because you need to) you are immediately pointed to the down elevator. Needless to say we ignored this instruction and went back out again as a 4 min stay seemed a little short. What a stupid design.\nThe view from the deck is very good but that is all it is - You cannot move around the rest of the deck and get other views and perspectives. It is too expensive and disappointing for what it is , you are treated as being in a sausage machine - take your money and get you up and down as quickly as possible . Avoid",

        "review_text": "It is seen from a distance, as a line stretched between three towers, a footbridge placed on the future. Marina Bay Sands is not a hotel, it is a symbol. A feat of architecture set on the bay, facing the light city of Singapore. We come here for luxury, of course, for elegant rooms, shopping galleries, Michelin-starred restaurants... but what we come looking for, what remains etched in the memory like an explosion of beauty, is the view.\nOn the 57th floor, everything opens. The sky, the port, the city. There, suspended in the heights, an open-air bar welcomes you. No needless flashing. Luxury here is the altitude, the space, the light. We sit down with a drink in hand — a cocktail with Asian accents, a New World wine, whatever. The main thing is elsewhere: Singapore at your feet.\nThe bay unfolds like an origami of glass and steel. Below, the Gardens by the Bay gardens draw their futuristic plant forms, huge metal trees pop up like a dream of Miyazaki. Further on, the port rustles with a distant activity, silent from the tops. And all around, the city. Vertical, effervescent, ordered like a giant microprocessor. A world-city, a 21st century city on the move, where nature slips between the towers like a breath. There are crystal-clear greenhouses, bridges, slender buildings, streets lit like arteries.\nAt night, the panorama becomes a spectacle. The bar turns into a headland on a world of lights. The laser show, the shimmering bay, the reflections... each sip becomes contemplation. We don't talk anymore. Or in a low voice, like in a temple.\nBecause that is what Marina Bay Sands is all about. A modern sanctuary. A steel and glass cathedral dedicated to the beauty of the world as it is built today. You can feel the power of Asia, the momentum of the future, but also, in the calm of this 57th floor, an unexpected form of peace. The tumult stays down. Up there, the wind grazes faces, the lights flash in the distance, and we understand that traveling is sometimes rising to see better.",

I especially loved the infinity pool, the breathtaking view from my room, and the gym! Although the gym has moved from the 55th floor to the third floor of the convention center, it was still an amazing facility.\n\nThey had not only treadmills but also a wide variety of weight machines. Since I prefer weight training over running, it perfectly matched my expectations.\n\nI was also incredibly grateful for the support from two lovely staff members, Chanok and Roselyn. They were so kind and helpful – thank you both so much! (Safe travels to Japan!)\n\nSome people might think it’s strange to have a training session in the middle of the day at Marina Bay Sands, but because I truly love working out, having a session in such a special place was unforgettable. I’d definitely love to come back again in the future.\n\nBy the way, the scent at the entrance of Marina Bay Sands was absolutely amazing. I’d love to enjoy that same fragrance at home. If any staff member happens to see this and can share the name of the fragrance or perfume used, I’d really appreciate it!",

Dyson hairdryer, mobile charger plate, Jo Malone toiletries, Toto toilet, cocktail bar…. Balcony peaceful and private with wonderful views over the gardens and water beyond.\nHowever, the arrival experience was really disappointing. The lobby isn’t really a lobby and is BUSY. You have to remember it’s part of a huge shopping/activity complex so there isn’t the usual relaxing lobby area where you can sit in comfy chairs with a drink and watch the world go by. There’s no separation between hotel guests and the general public. No doorman to greet us and take luggage. Check-in times strictly adhered to, so don’t turn up early. Our specified room wasn’t ready even after check-in time so we were compensated with a free breakfast, which was tasty but I would have still preferred the room to be ready.\nSwimming pool is a unique selling point and had been on my bucket list for some time. But it’s BUSY. And whilst I managed a brief swim, most people are there to take selfies and look at the view (both of which I did too) but for extended periods of time, so don’t expect to be able to do lengths. Overall, for the price paid it was a little disappointing but we would stay again if visiting the theatre and wanted just to relax in the room/on the balcony.",

        "review_text": "There were some concerns about the mall/airport/casino/obnoxious influencer vibes that other visitors mentioned, but my party of five wasn't exactly looking for tranquility. With something for everyone, and proximity to the MRT, after some deliberation, I settled on MBS for our three night stay in Singapore.\n\nWe arrived well after the appointed check in time, but the room was not yet ready. The receptionist generously granted S$100 credit to use at any hotel restaurant for the delay. She asked if we were celebrating any special occasion. I mentioned it was a family reunion of sorts. She offered a room upgrade to what I think was the Paiza Signature Suite with City View, but our room was much larger than what is described on their website. Truth be told, I was reluctant at first, being that we had two rooms booked with a need for space, but she assured me that this would be special.\n\nWe headed off to RISE, and were seated right away. The buffet was outstanding (better than the breakfast), but to elaborate would require a separate review. Within ten minutes, I received a text that the room was ready, so she didn't really have to do all that for such a minor inconvenience, but she did, and hey, we were all better off for it.\n\nOur suite was located in Tower 3. I did feel the airport vibe, but the lobby is just massive, so it's not as if you're maneuvering around people to get to where you're going. We finally got to our room, 4769, and our jaws just dropped. Gleaming marble floors, kitchen island, karaoke room, artwork, sculptures, dining room, living room, bathrooms, wardrobes, toilet seats that automatically go up when you open the door, it was just overwhelming. Words cannot describe. I took about four showers per day, not because I had to, but because I wanted to, and it had nothing to do with the Acqua di Parma toiletries.\n\nThe Infinity Pool (valid proper noun status) was downright relaxing, and never crowded. We ate Lavo twice, once dine-in, and once to go. Chilled a couple of times at Ce La Vie, which was ok, but you're better off getting your drink on poolside until 0000. Breakfast at RISE was very crowded. I would advise to get there early. I did check out the casino, but gambling is not my thing, and smoking is permitted, so that was a quick exit.\n\nAdmittedly, the fortunate upgrade enhanced my experience beyond all expectations, but in the end, we spent more time outside of the room than in it. The entire structure is impressive, you have the Supertree Grove in the back, fountain show at night, stunning skyline views, and the MRT to whisk you away for further exploration. Don't expect a cozy stay. This hotel is a destination on its own, with its stand tall, in your face, modern luxury amenities and design. To stay here is a treat to the senses.",

        "review_title": "A Dream Come True at Marina Bay Sands, Singapore",
        "review_text": "Sometimes, there are hotels you dream of staying in, but they seem just out of reach. During our last vacation, we made one of those dreams a reality, even if just for one night. Our dream was to swim in the world-famous infinity pool on the 57th floor of the iconic Marina Bay Sands hotel. After taking the leap and making the significant investment to check off this bucket list item, our adventure at this remarkable hotel began.\n\nUpon arrival, we were immediately struck by the incredible architecture and sheer scale of the hotel, which was overwhelming in the best way possible. However, due to its massive size, the check-in process felt more like checking in at an airport, with long queues and a less personal experience than we have had at other 5-star hotels. That being said, the reception staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming. Our son was immediately offered a treat, and since we were celebrating our 11th wedding anniversary, we were upgraded to a high-floor room with a balcony facing Gardens by the Bay. This upgrade added an extra layer of luxury, as we were able to watch the nightly light show from the comfort of our own room. Additionally, we were given early access to our room before the official check-in time, which was highly convenient, especially when traveling with a small child.\n\nOnce we entered the room, we were simply blown away. We have stayed in many beautiful hotels, but the attention to detail in this room was unparalleled. Every inch was thoughtfully designed to exude luxury. The bed was enormous and fitted with exceptionally soft and high-quality linens. The minibar was uniquely integrated into a stunning Chinese-style tea cabinet, adding a touch of elegance. The bathroom was spacious, beautifully designed, and stocked with premium amenities from Jo Loves by Jo Malone—a brand we were unfamiliar with until we looked it up and were amazed by its exclusivity. The amenities even included a pillow mist for relaxation, a delightful touch.\n\nThen came the highlight of our stay: the infinity pool. After taking two elevators to reach the top, we were warmly welcomed with complimentary water and towels. There was plenty of space around the pool, but one drawback was that many adults without children occupied the family-friendly section, making it uncomfortable for families with kids. Unfortunately, some of these guests seemed annoyed by the presence of children playing, despite there being a designated adults-only area, which, ironically, remained mostly empty. It was disappointing and frustrating, as proper signage was in place, but some guests clearly ignored it. Nevertheless, we thoroughly enjoyed our time at the pool, soaking in the breathtaking views. On our first day, with perfect weather, we could even see Malaysia and Indonesia in the distance.\n\nFor dining, we had both dinner and breakfast at Rise, the hotel’s restaurant located in the lobby. The dinner experience was excellent, while breakfast, though good, was quite crowded and felt a bit generic compared to other luxury hotels.\n\nOverall, our stay at Marina Bay Sands was truly unforgettable. It was an expensive indulgence, but the experience was worth every penny. From the unparalleled views to the luxurious room and the iconic infinity pool, it was a dream come true. If you’re considering a stay, even for just one night, we highly recommend making it happen—it’s an experience you’ll cherish forever.",

        "review_text": "Came here as the start to a bucket list solo trip with the infamous infinity pool being a big focus at first.\n\nBut that’s where I was surprised in a great way. From the moment I got out of my cab, staff was attentive and welcoming every part of the way.\n\nAs I was checking in, there was a minor quip of not having the room I booked available (balcony w Gardens by the Bay view) but it turned out for the better because they gave me a suite instead. Which to be quite honest was beyond my wildest expectations — complete with soaking tub, shower, living room, huge closet area, etc.\n\nThe morning after, I woke up early (easier to pull off due to my jet lag) to take advantage of the Infinity pool before sunrise and honestly, it was kind of surreal being nearly solo with that view. It’s also quite the scene to see at golden hour, but it’s definitely more crowded — not uncomfortably so but noticeable. You can also get free access to the SkyPark observation deck from the Tower 3 side if you’re looking for a different view.\n\nThe restaurants I went to were solid — both Spago Bar & Spago Dinjng Room, though I recommend booking ahead as slots fill up fast. The best way to describe both is blending European hits with local Singaporean flair.\n\nAs for the shops: if luxury is what you want, there’s no shortage there — bring your passport to take advantage of GST refunds.\n\nThere’s more I wanted to explore but given short period I stayed there (2 nights), I’ll just have to find my way back there soon.",

It wasn’t just an auditory experience, it was something you could feel. The sounds led me right down into a Deep meditative state that felt both grounded and wide open.\n\nIf you are in Singapore and you want to experience an ancient teaching of the heart, then I can't speak highly enough about it.

We arrived around 11am, and were allowed to access the pool area before our room was ready. At around 1pm we had a text asking us to make our way back to reception as our room was ready. To our amazement, they had upgraded us to an enormous suite, because it was my husband's birthday!\n\nThe room had a balcony overlooking the Gardens by the Bay and the sea beyond. It had a huge lounge and a huge bedroom, a walk in wardrobe, a huge bathroom. The room had so many features - things you didn't know you needed until you had them! Two robes each (one thick, one thin), slippers, heated loo seat, walk in shower, chargers built into the bedside tables. Just UNREAL. I worked out that the room we stayed in would have cost us about £1200 a night, had we been paying, and do you know what, I'd say it was actually worth that. Sublime luxury on so many levels. There was a cocktail stand with everything you needed to make several cocktails and so many snacks too. We didn't use these as they were chargeable. They also delivered a cake to the room!\n\nWe went to the pool and stayed there for a few hours. The infinity pool is amazing. Also, the beds mostly were double cabana type beds with sunshades which were really comfy. We both had burger and chips at the pool and 2 bottles of wine to share - all very reasonably priced given the location. We had planned to stay at the pool until it closed, but the room was so amazing that we wanted to spend time in it, so we went back there earlier than planned.\n\nLoads of lovely restaurants at the hotel, but we didn't eat at any, because we ate at the pool.\n\nVast shopping mall underground : beware there is nowhere to sit if you get tired easily. The food mall is good.\n\nThank you to the hotel for our amazing upgrade!!",

        "review_text": "I admit it... I'm frugal and I mostly stay at inexpensive hotels. My wife, bless her, usually doesn't complain (as long as she doesn't see rodents).\n\nI made an exception for Marina Bay Sands. It was the final night of a three-month tour of Southeast Asia, and I wanted to splurge. I wanted the most iconic building in Singapore. I wanted a view of the Gardens. And I really wanted to swim in the pool from the movie Crazy Rich Asians. This was kind of a \"bucket list\" item for me.\n\nFrom the moment we were dropped off, the service was impeccable and exceeded every expectation. Nirmal didn't just help with our bags -- he gave us a suggested itinerary for the evening. Raguvaaran didn't just deliver our bags, he gave us a thorough tour of our room (more on that later) and answered every question. At registration, Ruchelle didn't simply welcome us - she went out of her way to ensure our stay would be memorable. I can't thank her enough.\n\nWe were expecting a mini-suite, but our room was larger and nicer than any I've ever experienced: a large living area with a balcony overlooking the Gardens, a huge bedroom with its own balcony, a massive bathroom and a separate vanity. I don't design hotel rooms for a living, but if I did, this is how I'd do it. The attention to detail was evident everywhere: tasteful decoration, flower boxes on the balconies, wireless device charging, a proper bidet, great coffee and tea, delicious chocolates, drapes that automatically open when you enter the room, etc. And the shower was so large, you could have a meeting in there. (Not sure what kind of meeting you'd have in a shower, but still... it was big.)\n\nAnd yes, we did make it the pool that night after dinner, and the views of the evening city skyline were spectacular. Thanks to the MBS staff -- and especially Ruchelle -- we will never forget our stay. I eagerly look forward to coming back one day.",

I left feeling completely refreshed, both physically and mentally.\n\nEverything about this spa—the impeccable service, the serene atmosphere, and the professionalism of the staff—was top-tier.

I imagined more luxury ..\nThe room is nothing that breakfast I did not use and the bridge desk on the 60th floor is great for an aperitif (50 € upwards) but in the end it is all scene this hotel\nGreat location in front of the gardens next to the museum and certainly in the most beautiful area of Singapore\nCompletely touristy",

On discovering this was the last night of our trip the member of staff on Reception, Alex, very kindly looked through the system and arranged for us to receive a courtesy upgrade. Upon arriving in our room we were blown away to discover we were in fact in one of the very best suites on the 54th floor in tower one! I have never seen or stayed in a hotel room as luxurious as this ever! It wasn’t just a room it was the size of an apartment.\n\nEverywhere we went within the hotel we were made to feel respected and special and we also received a celebration cake delivered to our room. It really did make for an amazing ending to a special trip celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary.\n\nThank you so much Alex and Marina Bay Sands, it is an experience we will never forget.",

Our driver not only ensured a smooth and comfortable ride but also shared fascinating bits of history about the city. Upon arrival, our premium service host greeted us with a genuine smile and escorted us to our stunning room, offering a breathtaking view of the city. She took the time to thoroughly explain all the room’s features and the hotel’s amenities.\n\nEvery experience, from the iconic Infinity Pool to the exceptional dining, was flawless. The staff went above and beyond to make me feel special, especially since I was celebrating a birthday, and I truly felt treated like royalty.\n\nFor anyone visiting Singapore, Marina Bay Sands is the ultimate place to stay.

We bought tickets in advance for the observation deck, but the staff were very helpful and let us up early as we'd arrived before our time slot. The views over Singapore were amazing!\nI would recommend visiting early in the morning or in the evening as there isn't any shade unless you have access to the pool area or eat in the restaurant.",

        "review_text": "Absolutely the best/ most luxurious hotel we’ve ever stayed in ( 2 adults x 1 child). We had Eunice guide us to our room and give us a run through all the features of our stay, she was so sweet and even sang us a lovely song. I even had a lovely surprise bouquet of flowers and wine delivered to my room for my birthday all organised by Eunice, the nicest surprise I’ve ever received. We only stayed there for 2 nights but I wish it was for my whole 8 days in Singapore. Everywhere we looked it was new surprises and features of the hotel and room we didn’t see earlier. I can’t fit all my amazements into a review, it would go on forever. I highly recommend staying here if you can afford the splurge. The buffet breakfast at the Rise, had all the options you could want (bacon, eggs, cereal, yoghurts, fruits and international styles of food too, Arabic, Chinese and Indian). The restaurant we ate dinner at was Lavo (Italian) book in advance, it was delicious, my husband’s Italian and he was very pleased with the lasagne. Again I could go on and on. Special thanks to Eunice for making our family stay the best we’ve ever had.",

Wai Ling took exceptional care of me, ensuring that every detail was perfect. Her technique was nothing short of extraordinary—every movement was intentional, every touch was soothing, and she seemed to know exactly what my body needed.\n\nI have never felt such deep relaxation before. It was as if all the tension I had been carrying melted away with each passing minute. The pressure was perfect, the ambiance was serene, and the entire experience felt like a true escape from reality.\n\nBy the time the session ended, I could hardly believe how rejuvenated I felt. It was pure bliss from start to finish. If you’re looking for a massage that transcends expectations and leaves you feeling completely renewed, I cannot recommend Wai Ling enough. Absolutely incredible!",

Our family was lucky enough to score a free upgrade from our original 2 rooms we booked, to a Paiza Signature Suite (2-Bedroom) - City View in Tower 3. This was really a next-level experience for us.\nThe attention to detail was fantastic in this room, as well as the shear sqm on offer. 2 bedrooms with ensuites, huge living area with lounge and dining and kitchen facilities. The massage chair was also a hit after a long day seeing the sights. We didn't use the separate audiovisual room with the karaoke machine, but I would imagine some people would.\nIf you have a lot of money burning a hole in your pocket that you simply must relieve yourself of, then the boutique shopping of the Marina Bay Sands \"Shoppes\" is within a 10 minute walk and you can find yourself most anything you would like. But this is not a \"budget\" shopping experience.\nThe hotel is also very close to the Marina Bay Gardens.\nBut for us, the best part of this hotel was the unfettered access you have to the roof top infinity pool. Lounging in and by this pool and its heated Jacuzzis scatted around the deck, brings home the engineering marvel this building is. A superb surreal experience.",

We booked one night here as it’s expensive and we wanted to tick it off the bucket list. We paid £400 for the one night which was the cheapest room. We arrived quite early as our plan was to drop our bags and do the cloud forest / flower dome whilst we waited to check in however they congratulated us on our honeymoon and allowed us to check in straight away . I believe we got an upgrade as we had gardens by the bay view and a cake was sent to our room also. Lovely gestures by the hotel. The room was stunning with a huge bed and HUGE tv. There was beautiful pink flowers growing on the balcony . We weren’t that high up so we had a pretty direct view of gardens by the bay right outside the window. The mini bar was stocked with complimentary drinks. We spent the majority of the time at the pool which is incredible. I stayed there until it closed at midnight and got back up for the pool opening at 6am where I watched the sunrise and had breakfast . I would love to come back and stay for longer.\nWe booked directly with the hotel which gives you back some resort dollars which I then used to buy things in the bath and body works downstairs in the mall area.",

        "review_text": "I debated long and hard to splurge on a stay at MBS - so glad I did!! We arrived in Singapore from the US in the morning and were able to drop our bags off the hotel and hit the ground running! Location, location, location! So close to Gardens by the Bay, the MRT, shops, restaurants. Lau Pa Sat and Merlion Park are 10-15 min walks. It made it so easy not to have to sort out details on jet lag and little sleep. The stay was the start of our trip to celebrate our daughter’s college graduation and my husband’s 70th birthday. The hotel kindly and thoughtfully upgraded us to a view of the GBTB and left a birthday cake in our room! We loved seeing the light show up-close at the park and then from our room. The room itself is really wonderfully designed, the curtains open when you walk in, the bathroom is spacious, smart lighting guides you at night to the WC. We had access to the pool (and went both days) without needing to make a reservation (perhaps b/c it was rainy season??) and it wasn’t crowded at all. We had delicious cocktails and appetizers at Spago (all the employees we asked recommended Spago over Ce La Vie) and you feel like one of the beautiful people (JK!). Do make a reservation. The staff was kind and helpful. Be sure to sign up for the VIP program for discounts back. I wouldn’t go into debt to stay here, but if you can afford it, it really is lovely and memorable and helps maximize enjoyment of a quick visit to Singapore.",

The moment we stepped into the suite, any trace of fatigue disappeared. Everything is tastefully decorated, the spaces are extremely generous, and the view from the windows is breathtaking—you truly feel like a VIP.\n\nThe food served in the hotel's restaurants is delicious and diverse, catering to all tastes.\n\nGardens by the Bay is an irresistible attraction, accessible right from the hotel lobby.\n\nThe pool on the 57th floor is truly a place where you are treated at the highest level—both literally and figuratively.\n\nI don’t think we could have ended a memorable vacation in a better way than by choosing Marina Bay Sands.",

Still, I will write it.\n\nWe chose \"Taylor Swift; Shake It Off\" package on 3rd March, 2024.\nMs. Jemcy Rodriguez, who served us, was very friendly and she was of help to us. I also remember Heather from Myanmar who escorted us at the airport. I was impressed that she said she liked Korean culture. Many other staff members gave us a good image of this hotel.\n\nThe room condition was perfect. First of all, it was very spacious and the view of Gardens by the Bay was very nice.\nThe swimming pool, restaurant, and shopping mall were large and diverse, so it was easy to use. This place is worth the price. I will be leaving Korea soon, and I am very looking forward to this trip.",

        "review_text": "My friend and I were staying for 3 nights in this hotel to attend an activity nearby in Nov 2022. At first we were fascinated by how modern and grand everything in this hotel looked, but its services later turned out to be a real nightmare.\n\nThe first night started with a disturbing sound from 2:30am for every 5-minute interval arising by the pressure from the pipe system. After 15-20 minutes we could not stand with the noise and decided to call for a check. A technician then came to our room, inspected and asked if we want a room change we should call the front desk on our own, so we explained everything to the reception, but we were offered a downgrade without any compensation or had to wait until the morning for their management team to get back to work. We turned down this unacceptable offer and asked them to reply as soon as possible BUT NOT UNTIL THE MORNING. Half an hour later we were given a same grade of room, with card keys delivered to our new room and our stay extended to 2pm on our last day. Why would such a 5-star hotel have no 24-hour management for emergency situations?\n\nOn the next day we were pleasantly surprised they delivered some great truffle chocolates and a bottle of champagne for the inconvenience caused. However on the last day, after we finished relaxing at the fascinating infinity pool on the top floor at 12pm, our card keys stopped working, and after lining up at the lobby with our swimwear to find out what happened, we figured out the card keys worked until 12pm but not 2 as promised. The reception lady named Adele claimed we should approach them for an extension. How in the world will the customers understand THE WAY YOUR SYSTEM WORKS?????? Why are not the card keys being delivered to our room???? Or a note saying our cards should be replaced????\n\nBy the time we checked in, we were told that the amounts we spent in Marina Bay Sands hotel mall could be accumulated as points, which can be used to reduce our room price when we check out. However by the checkout time, the same lady Adele decided to settle the payment as quick as she could without even bother asking whether we had any points available. It was not until we raised out how our points could be utilized, she then realized we had points to use. She even urged us to spend more on the hotel shops before even trying to void the invoice so that, we believe, she did not bear any responsibility for her mistakes. However we of course refused to spend further and eventually got our points deducted from the room price by her manager with the previous settlement voided.\n\nWe had to say the facilities in the hotels are awesome, including the gym, sauna, steam bath, restaurants, and especially the infinity pool. The rooms are flawlessly clean. However we were very disappointed with this terrible experience happening in a 5-star hotel as an icon of Singapore. The services seriously need intense improvement.\n\nP.S. I am reposting this review now after being horrified by the fact that this review has been deleted by the request of this hotel, when I believe this review should stay to have the management reflect what they are doing.",

We have 2 rooms and I don't have any idea that it is different kind of rooms because my kids booked the room as a gift for the whole family but she is able to put us on the same tower and she did something more than that, she upgraded our room to a suite room with a beautiful combination view of sea and gardens by the bay. The room is perfect, everything is perfect!!! We did not ask for anything because all we want is to take a shower and grab dinner but she gave us a list of the shows every night with the popular food spot where we can have a dinner. She's very thoughtful and very helpful to us. She's a gem in the hotel!!! I hope we can meet her again on our next visit with our friends. By the way, the housekeeping staff did a very good job!

Access to the pool is, indeed, restricted to hotel guests only and this is an experience that you might want to do at least once in a lifetime. The hotel is a huge complex that incorporates Shops, the Casino, the catwalk to the Gardens By The Bay and the Subway Station! It is sure worth a visit also from an architectural and design point of view. Rooms were great; I stayed both in a suite and in a regular deluxe room and, apart from the obvious differences in the service levels, both rooms were spacious, extremely clean and very well attended to by what must be an army of personnel. Although the lobby might be a little impersonal as most of the clubs and restaurants, it is in my opinion the landmark of Singapore and one of the best attractions",

Wow that's wonderful service & very kind and it made our stay even more brilliant.\nThis Hotel oozes opulence, it's classy, tasteful & glamorous!\nWe overlooked the Gardens & the views were beautiful!\nThe staff were amazing, very friendly & accommodating.\nYes the pool area is beyond magnificent & breathtaking!!!\nWe swam at 5am and had the pool & views to ourselves. First guests started arriving around 5.30am/6am. Those first 30mins were out of this world, like a dream, like floating in the sky!!\nThe rooftop viewing area is stunning!\nBreakfast buffet options were absolutely delicious & dinner too.\nWe thoroughly enjoyed our stay, it was a splurge worth every single cent!!",

        "review_text": "We spent 4 days 3 nights at Mbs from 24th Dec.\nRooms as usual were amazing, counter staff were all courteous and polite.\nWe were fortunate to attend 2 yoga classes by Bala in the morning and we highly recommend it. He is super passionate and we could feel it it's infectious. If I could rate the experience with Bala its a solid 10/10.\n\nVery unfortunately our entire experience was let down at the pool on 26th morning.\nOn the 25th morning we went to the pool as quite a big group (we had 4 rooms) and only a few of us tapped in with no issues.\nOn the 26th , we were stopped by Sandra and her colleague. My sister and a few went ahead first and when I reached with my baby and helper, along with my family. I tapped in my card wanting to enter but was stopped because we were told guests strictly require a card each to enter. What went horribly wrong and distasteful was how this message was delivered. In fact Sandra asked us ' who let you all in yesterday?' I of course couldn't remember who would. When I told her I couldn't she went on asking ' what is their name.. is it one man one woman or 2 women..' a few times... Seriously is it my responsibility to remember who let us in the day before? I felt I was being interrogated??? Ironically in a 5 star hotel. She was exceptionally rude, along with the aunty colleague. My sister who was helplessly standing said when she tried to explain they added a bed so they only had 2 cards instead of 3. The aunty told her ' add bed is bed add card is card'\n\nObjectively speaking, Sandra and aunty did a great job upholding the hotel policy but we are not objects. If the delivery was done better we understand. We truly respect the policy. But not in a tone where we were being doubted like overstayer or non hotel guests!\n\nCan you imagine going to a Michelin restaurant served a wonderful dish but you spotted a fly in it. The whole experience was entirely ruined.\n\nI remember Sandra kept asking for her colleagues names but I recommend your team to check cctv. Also, thanks to her, I only remember names who provided excellent and atrocious service.",

        "review_text": "Our visit to Marina Bay Sands Singapore was meant to be a special trip for our beloved Dad’s 77th birthday—a celebration we had saved up for as a simple, middle-class family wanting to give him an unforgettable experience. We arrived in Singapore excited but never imagined the overwhelming kindness and generosity that would come our way.\n\nFrom the moment we stepped out of our cab, we were greeted by warm smiles from the doormen and porters, instantly making us feel welcome. However, what truly left us speechless was Khai at the front desk, who, with kindness and generosity, upgraded us from a suite to the stunning Merlion Suite. We were already feeling a little out of place in such a luxurious setting, but his hospitality and grace reassured us that we were valued guests.\n\nThen came Robby from Premium Services—a man with wit, intellect, kindness, and a heart of gold. He not only ensured we had access to every incredible perk of the Merlion Suite—from indulgent breakfasts and delightful lunches to afternoon cocktails—but also went the extra mile to arrange two limousines to take our entire family (and our many bags) to the airport. His generosity and warmth left us humbled and, at times, even embarrassed by the sheer level of attention we received.\n\nAnd then there were Justine and Arabella, who truly made us feel like VIPs. Not only did they escort us through check-in at the airport, but they also stayed with us until every bag was checked, every detail was taken care of, and our flights were confirmed. Their level of dedication was something we had never experienced before, and it was done with genuine kindness and care.\n\nWe came for the pool, like many do, but we left knowing that the greatest strength of Marina Bay Sands isn’t just its world-class amenities—it’s its people. Every member of the team we encountered was meticulously screened and trained, yet it was their genuine warmth and sincerity that made all the difference.\n\nWe never expected to be treated like royalty—we felt out of place, undeserving, and overwhelmed—but the entire staff at MBS treated us with such care and respect that we will forever be grateful. This trip was supposed to be a gift for our Dad, but in the end, we were the ones who received a gift—the experience of a lifetime, filled with kindness, generosity, and memories we will cherish forever.\n\nFrom the bottom of our hearts, thank you, Marina Bay Sands, for making us feel like we belonged, even when we thought we didn’t. We will never forget this.",

        "review_text": "I surprised my husband with a sunrise sound meditation experience on the top of the Marina Bay Sands with Karu and Bala. We had such an incredible grounding meditation with the guided breathwork and the sounds played. Karu and Bala hold a wealth of knowledge about sound, and how we can use its vibrations to ground ourselves from our busy daily lives. After the session, we both felt ourselves feeling more connected and in-tune with ourselves and our surroundings. They offered to teach us more about their plethora of instruments after the session and gave everyone a sound bath as well. The frequencies, vibrations and tones were felt throughout our nervous system, promoting improved moods and relaxed bodies. It was such a perfect morning, and it was even more special that we were able to do this at the top of the beautiful Marina Bay Sands.",

During the session, it felt like I was home. So relaxing😁\nOne thing I would suggest is that if there would be 2 staff in a room, they should both know the language the customer is more comfortable speaking. Because if one staff does and speaks to us a lot, the other might feel left out and awkward. But overall, it was a relaxing and spectacular spa-experience. From my mom, it was amazing.\nSherly was very polite and kind as well. Although she didn’t know Chinese, it was still so fun to go through this experience with her. Helping my mom go through this amazing experience as well.\nThank you for providing us with snacks! I love them! 😍",

Proximity to Gardens by the bay, Museums and Malls deliver endless possibilities to fill your day..A truly spectacular experience.",

Everything from a Nintendo Switch in the kids bunk room to a full body massage chair in the private office off the master bedroom. We mentioned during booking that it was our anniversary and they unexpectedly delivered a chocolate cake to us in the evening. The rooftop pool lives up to its reputation and didn’t seem crowded due to its huge size. We went in the day and night and both unique memorable experiences. Perfect water temperature.

Check-in takes too long and was a hassle, while for breakfast I found myself in a line every morning. The procedure to be seated is strangely bureaucratic and is guest unfriendly. This can be much better for this hotel.\nRestaurants are good but overpriced. You pay for the view, rather than the food itself. CeLaVi was for us the best.\nRooms are honestly great, everything you can wish for is available. Design is good and super efficiently organized. The bed and mattress are excellent.

        "review_text": "What can I say about Marina Bay Sands that hasn’t already been said. Although I am going back a while now, I still remember our stay there as clear as yesterday.\nWe walked into a very busy hotel lobby and were immediately checked in. The staff from beginning to end were exceptionally helpful and polite. We did not have to queue as we were given a private room to check in and have our bags taken up. Effortless! The staff seemed to add lots of little details as I had made them aware it was my partners birthday. The room was immaculate, comfortable and very very clean. The bathroom was clean and the shower was…….fun!\nThe views over the bay and city were breathtaking through the floor to ceiling windows. You really could not ask for more especially when the light and firework show came on over the bay.\nThe infinity pool on the top floor is obviously a sight, but I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to get a lounger. Singapore is very humid, so I was expecting the pool to be busy in a Saturday night but it’s huge so there really is plenty of room for all.\nThe Marina Bay Sands hotel is an experience. It throws lavishness and opulence at you without any grace or style. That’s not a bad thing. It’s the type of place that looks great for influencers and the YouTube generation which is where we are now. There is no space for toning things down. If you’ve just got the money and want to impress a first weekend date, this place is ostentatious enough to fully meet your needs.\nIt scores a top spot for us because we only wanted to stay here a couple of nights to end our 2 week holiday in opulence. And for those 2 nights it was perfect.",

The suite was perfect and felt like it came out of a dream! Every detail was masterfully designed in our room! The Tea settings, spa bath supplies, endless supply of Voss water, various choices of tea, coffee and all other cocktail & alcohol we can think of. We chose to buy a selection of food items at the MBS Food Hall and eat dinner at the fully appointed dining room in our suite. We had all the supplies needed for a dinner party and all was perfect. The Guest Services team provided everything we needed within 5- 10 minutes of us requesting.\n\nFitness Services : It rained lightly in the morning so our Meditation class was cancelled. Although they were delayed in communicating the class status with us, the MBS Personal Trainer, Oddie, was kind enough to bring us to the Sky Deck for pictures. It would be great if MBS could have alternate venues for their Meditation Class - somewhere indoors in the hotel to allow guests to still get this activity done.\n\nSince we were checking out that day, Paula, from the front desk arranged for our shower room later in the day and gave us clear instructions on how to get the best out of our pool day.\n\nJuan from the Bell Desk took care of our arrival & departure needs and made sure our 14 bags got to where they needed to be. The Paiza residence experience is unreal! We still dream about Marina Bay Sands and look forward to returning for the 4th time!!!",

        "review_text": "Marina Bay Sands is, without doubt, the most beautiful and suggestive hotel I have ever stayed in. Aesthetically wonderful and majestic, it manages to perfectly combine its imposing size with an impeccable organization.\nThe room was spacious, elegant, bright and equipped with every possible comfort. From breathtaking views to details such as full toiletries (toothbrush, soaps, shampoos, creams, bathrobe, slippers, etc.), to luxury amenities: a 75-inch TV, wireless charger, coffee machine, minibar and cocktails available, snacks, and even a heated toilet with automatic bidet. Nothing was missing.\nThe infinity pool on the 57th floor is the flagship of the hotel: indescribable, exciting, breathtaking. An experience that alone is worth the stay.\nAll the operators were extremely kind and professional, and the reception was always helpful and efficient, despite the management of over 2000 rooms.\nThe hotel is also home to several top-notch restaurants, offering a variety of options that complement the luxury experience.\nWhat about it? It was a 10 and praise experience. Yes, it is an expensive hotel, but for such a unique stay it is absolutely worth it. Hope to return soon!",

        "review_text": "Many choose the Sands for its iconic statue, a chance to take a dip in the infinity pool, easy access to Garden by and Bay and of course, high end shopping, and we are no exception. One can easily mistaken for a hotel in Vegas when stepping into the lobby (and, within the shopping mall) , but those looking for tranquility would probably not select the Sands. The newly renovated premiere suite offers a stunning view over the bay and the Straits. The room is beautifully laid out and appointed, and the state of the art Television can be addictive for bedtime watching. The suite is spacious, airy and brightly lit, with 2 lovely balconies adjacent to the living room and the bedroom. All the modern amenities associated with a 5 star hotel are presented.\nThe premiere suite comes with premium services that include transfer to and from the hotel, meet and greet on arrival and departure, check in and out are administered in the suite which were highly helpful considering the crowds arriving and departing. The premiere suite also allows access to the club (similar to executive lounge) which, was probably the most disappointing aspect of the stay, as on the 2 occasions that we tried to gain entry (one at around 5pm and the other at around 0930 am), the wait time has been more than one hour, and for anyone trying to have breakfast, make sure that you get in before 8am, otherwise, the wait can easily be anytime between 60-90 minutes. Our stay was over the weekend so perhaps that could be a contributing reason for such long wait, in the end, we did not manage to get any breakfast nor access to the lounge. The other slightly annoying factor is that the hotel lobby provides access to the mall, skypark, and Garden by the Bay (and of course the Casino), so it is swamped by visitors, therefore trying to get help from the staff in the lobby can be tricky, as they cannot differentiate between hotel guests or visitors. All being said, it is nonetheless a worthy stay.",

        "review_text": "Wow wow wow!!\nWe arrived knowing that this was going to be a special trip, to an amazing hotel and we were not disappointed. When asked on arrival why we had chosen the Marina, I said it was for my wife’s 50th birthday and our 30th wedding anniversary, and she had always wanted to stay here. Unfortunately our room was not quite ready so we popped off to the shopping mall, grabbed a coffee, and soon after got an email to say room was ready and good to check in.\nCheck in presented us with an upgrade on behalf of the hotel for my wife…….to a palacial suite, one of their new renovated suites, which was lovely to hear and we thanked them accordingly.\nThe room we entered was unbelievable, we have both never seen anything like this and were just in awe, the views of the city, the gizmos and gadgets, the attention to detail was just mind blowing.\nOur 2 nights were awesome, everything was great superb staff, awesome walks out into the city, food at every point was great, the gardens were superb to visit and it was just perfect, it genuinely couldn’t have been any better!!!",

        "review_text": "I stayed many times before the coronavirus, but it was the first time I stayed after the coronavirus.\n\nWhen I used Banyan Tree at the spa the year before after COVID-19, I showed my passport and became a member because I got a membership status of Sands Rewards member Prestige, 10% off meals and accommodation, etc., for a limited time if I showed my Japanese passport.\n\nWhen the trip in March 2024 was approaching, I wanted to check something out, so I confirmed the reservation by phone from Marina Bay Sands website, where I could also call from Japan, and was surprised to hear that the deadline for Prestige membership had passed, so it would be charged at the rate of the day I arrived.\n\nWhen I asked if there was a way to retain Prestige members, I was in a hurry to create an SMBC crèca when I heard that if I had some kind of card for the campaign I was running, I could.\n\nWhen I took a breather and called to confirm at a later date, they told me this time that I could only use the Prestige membership benefits once in the campaign, and that if I made a new card to keep that Prestige membership, it would be ok, otherwise it would be the rate of arrival on the day, but they were wrong, and said they wouldn't worry as the 10% off room rate booked when they were Prestige members would still apply. So, I made a credit card without meaning, but anyway, I avoided the worst of it, which was the accommodation rate on the day.\n\nSafe and checked in on the day. The waiting line is long, but the counter is also full of staff, so we proceed quickly. They hand out water along the way and use the VIP check-in at the back more sometimes, so there is no discomfort. We were lucky enough to be led to a VIP check-in, where we sat on the sofa and checked in.\n\nI definitely wanted a bathtub in the room, so I booked a city view in the Premier Room. It happened to be a corner room, and the harbor view was a bit visible from the bathroom. However, please note that this bathroom is fully visible from the hallway, so if you do not use a roll curtain when using the bathroom, you can see it from the hallway.\n\nThe price was higher than before the coronavirus, but it was renovated and the room was easier to use than before.\n\nThe bath used to have just a bowl-like bath, but after the renovation, a square-shaped, stable bathtub was fine.\n\nIt was fun and nice to have a separate shelf with coffee and tea and chocolate.\n\nYou can choose where to have breakfast, but again I had it in the spago on the top floor for the view and the sense of freedom. It's crowded, so it's better to book breakfast as well. Reservations can be made through the WEB .\n\nBe careful not to enter the observation deck at certain times.\n\nBefore my stay, I had to deal with a lot of things about the price, but they were kind to me every time I called. However, no offense, but it was a bit difficult because the information was not thorough enough and varied from person to person.\n\nBut if you stay, the view is spectacular. And the room was clean, and it was nice to see the housekeeping staff really smiling and welcoming when we passed each other down the hall.\n\nTaxis are also easy to catch in front of the hotel, and there are many hotels where you have to wait a long time to get a taxi, so it's easy to get a taxi, and close to Marina Bay Sands shopping centre and MRT station.\n\nThe status of the Sands Rewards Prestige member can also be extended again with this stay, and I have accumulated points (resort dollars), so I want to stay again next time.",

        "review_text": "Extremely disappointed with my stay at Marina Bay Sands. I was placed in a room in tower 3 currently undergoing renovation which was unbearably loud and the jack hammer drilling lasted for the majority of the day. When I asked to move to a different location away from the renovation I was asked to pay an additional S$200 p/n. I had paid a lot of money for this hotel to begin with and it is the worst hotel stay I have ever experienced. I had a bad migraine and was unable to leave my room and the ridiculously loud construction work made me feel more unwell. I am shocked that anyone would be placed in a room near the construction with the extreme noise and disturbance. Especially considering the price! I complained several times and asked to speak to the general manager who told me there were no other rooms available in the whole hotel and was offered credit for some food to be sent to my noisy room which was unbearable.\n\nThe construction noise is unbearable and there is loud drilling for the majority of the day.

        "review_text": "We stayed here for one night after a cruise. We had previously stayed in Singapore prior to our cruise at another top rated hotel and wanted to compare the two hotels. In the end, the other hotel won (RC).\nWhen we first entered the hotel early morning we found ourselves in a long queue waiting to reach the check in desk. The check in area is very long with many desk clerks. When you reach the desk you are squeezed into a desk area of about 60cm ( it feels like that). I had difficulty maintaining my space as other people checking in kept pushing me. Our room was not ready so we organised to stow our bags and went to explore Singapore. When we arrived back at the hotel we discovered we had received an upgraded room. This was fantastic. We had a view directly on to the marina bay gardens and were level with the flower bombs. These flowers bombs have two shows of illumination per evening and luckily we were able to catch one display. Great display!\nThe breakfast was good, but not great. There was quite a good choice but we felt the quality of the western food was not up to the standard it should have been. We thought breakfast was included in our reservation details but apparently it wasn’t and that led to a slightly awkward discussion before we entered the restaurant.\nThe hotel has a wonderful infinity pool on the top floor, and some restaurants. Unfortunately these are not only for hotel guests. The hotel guests have guest only elevators to their rooms and up to the pool area. Somehow we found one person who did not have a room key card for the elevator and she managed to rise to the intermediate transfer level.\nI guess this was reported as next day there were security staff checking room key cards at the lift entrances.\nOne thing we did not like compared to other Asian hotels we had been to was that there was absolutely no welcome greeting as you entered the hotel. The door staff do not care. We think the reason is that there are so many curious tourists entering the hotel that the staff just do not know who is a genuine guest and who is a casual sightseeing tourist. Maybe the hotel should issue the guests with a badge to wear to make it obvious who is a guest! Another problem in the hotel is that there are no seats to sit on in the ground floor area. That means if you have checked out and are waiting for transport or something, you can’t sit down! We asked about seats and were told to go to the roof area where the infinity pool is. The problem there is that there is no air conditioning so, as we were checked out and waiting 5 hours before our flight home, we had an uncomfortable day.\nThe hotel is certainly beautiful and in a great location, but we felt let down that the customer care normally associated with high standard hotels just did not exist.",

The infinity pool alone is worth the money - views and sunset incredible. Room was great with views over the gardens on the bay and above balcony great for an early coffee.

        "review_text": "The hotel itself is excellent, the rooms or should I say suites are really good, comfortable and full of technology. Among the best I have been a guest in. We stayed in 2018 and I now refresh my review due to refurbishment. We weren’t impressed with the check-in which should have been earlier due to our type of booking however, when we arrived, the private check in was in disarray and unorganised. However, on arrival in our suite, we were not disappointed. We ate in the Lavo Italian restaurant, which stated it had a dress code. This was not adhered to and we found our selves in amongst women in jeans and men in shorts. It was quite pricey and the food quality was disappointing. This did take away from the enjoyment of the hotel, however,the access to the rooftop pool and the comfort and excellence of the room & breakfast delivered to our dining area made up for this. We paid a hefty £595 GBP for our one night treat we felt this could have been a lot less due to the check-in and restaurant.",

        "review_text": "I stayed here for 2 nights to celebrate our anniversary.\n\nThis is truly a bucket list hotel and even though we had high expectations, they were SURPASSED! This is the best hotel I've stayed in my life including other luxury hotels like the Langham or St. Regis. Now every future hotel stay will be measured against MBS!\n\nOf course the location is stunning and the access to the rooftop infinity pool is often cited as the main reason to choose MBS. However, the entire stay was incredible -- I would stay here even without the pool!\n\nThe design, attention to detail and amenities are wonderful but what really makes MBS stand out is how well-trained and consistently great the staff are. They are helpful without being intrusive and always kind and courteous, even if we aren't high rollers who stay at these kind of hotels very often. Sometimes in fancier hotels it can feel stuffy or snobby, but here I felt they treated everyone well, whether you are wearing designer clothes or you're like me in your Uniqlo gear :P\n\nRoom:\nWe got upgraded to a suite - maybe because we said it's our anniversary or because they are doing construction on tower 1. They also surprised us with a chocolate cake in our room with \"Happy Anniversary\".\n\nThe room was huge with a nice city view, impeccably clean, cozy design (I wish my living room looked like this), everything you could possible need. Smart lighting and temperature adjustment. Smart TV. Waffle AND terry cloth robes. Slippers of different sizes (as a woman with small feet, I usually never use hotel slippers as they are one size and usually way too big). Bath tub with a tray to hold your phone etc and bath bomb AND bath salts. Jo Malone toiletries. Toto toilet. Dyson hair dryer. Speaker in the bathroom so you can listen to music/TV while in the bath. Jewelry box. Chocolate truffles. TWG teas. In room pre-mixed cocktails (extra cost but very reasonable, like $19 each). Super cozy bed with nice linens. Nice design-y coffee table books. Free MBS postcards. Thoughtful turndown service -- they noticed I was using a ratty old movie ticket as a bookmark and stuck a beautiful MBS bookmark in my book!! Like COME ON, talk about attention!! If your charger is really long, they will wind it up and clip it in place. It's basically like being at home but BETTER.\n\nWellness:\nThe spa is sadly closed at this time. But I took advantage of the free access to wellness classes for hotel guests (normally around $30 for the general public). I did the morning sound bath on the observation ticket. What a magical and unique experience! So relaxing and peaceful. I also signed up for the morning pilates class but it was raining so it was cancelled. Instead I went to the gym. For the past year the gym has moved to a different building but it is attached to the hotel via underground and you can walk there in 5 mins, passing by the casino. The gym has state of the art equipment and everything you would expect including cardio machines, free weights plus extra like that mirror fitness app (you do classes using the app), massage gun, fruit infused water, coffee/tea, lockers for your valuables and headphones in case you forgot your own. There is a change room attached as well, in case you already checked out of the hotel and need a place to freshen up. Arif and Lucy were very kind and helpful in orienting me to the gym area.\n\nFood:\nWe didn't eat at any of the restaurants except for breakfast at Origin & Bloom (casual grab & go cafe in the lobby) one day. Great cappuccino and breakfast sandwiches, reasonably priced. The food court at the Shoppes @ MBS is really nice and has great variety.\n\nPool:\nAmazing. Be sure to visit during the day and at night for different vibes. I was worried it would be crowded since it is such a famous pool. But it is really long, so even when it is busy, there is no problem finding your own space in the pool and getting lounge chairs. There are always staff around to help you get a towel. There's also a free sunscreen dispenser, so smart. Keep in mind there is not a lot of shade in the lounge area (no umbrellas), so sun protection is a must. The pool itself is shallow and I swam around a bit, but it's more of a pool to relax in rather than to swim laps.\n\nThere is a professional photographer going around in the pool and taking photos that you can buy later, but we chose to just take our own photos (bring a waterproof phone cover - or buy one from the gift shop). They have discounted drinks at night (I forgot what time but it is 2 for 1). It's easy to miss the jacuzzis which are facing the opposite direction as the infinity pool. Those are really nice at night!\n\nCheck-in/check-out:\nSmooth and efficient. They collect your luggage right away from your taxi/car and tag them so that by the time you are checked in and go to your room, your luggage is there waiting for you. Express check out was easily done online and then you just drop your keys at the desk.\n\nOverall, so impressed with this hotel. It's basically flawless and lived up to the hype. Would stay here again when in Singapore.",

We love our view: the beautiful lights of Gardens by the Bay! Our family suite is just perfect. Just what we wanted: with kitchen and washer dryer, modern Japanese Bidet toilet. Not all rooms have these, but so surprised when the selection opened up. All the finest things are in there- from the Jo Malone soaps and lotion to the best TWG tea flavors! The service is just way and above expectations: the welcome chocolates are so good and other treats are so fancy! I am really impressed on how they show their gesture of hospitality. They even gave a cute, Marina Bay Sands Lego set that my son was eyeing on for his birthday. Too many nice things to mention, but specially the warmest welcome and service we got from the time we were picked up from our previous hotel...riding their Limo Van really made us all feel so VIP, up to the private check in process by Ms. Glaiza and Ms. Julie (both charming and very warm and very accommodating ) , up to the concierge - Leo really explained all the good places to visit, complete with different maps and illustrations. They know how to treat their guests here. Nothing bad to say about this hotel, all are above super special only. The pool is the best in the world, by the way, and the view up there is just spectacular. One should expect though, that this is a luxury hotel, and it does not come cheap, but it's just so worth it. People save up for a good vacation, I would say, it's the same as this experience. Would definitely return to MBS when in Singapore!",

We arrived early in the morning & unfortunately our room wasn't available but we were allowed to access the infinity pool. We had packed our swimming costumes in our hand luggage so we could enjoy the pool for several hours until our room was ready. The pool area was almost empty so it was a real treat (especially when we visited early evening and saw how busy it was). My only criticism is that it would have been nice if just one section of the huge pool area didn't have the constant beat of bass 'music'. That apart, I loved the pool & we enjoyed having it almost to ourselves. Reception emailed me when our room was ready & we were delighted when we saw our beautiful newly refurbished room on level 21 of Tower 1. Spacious & tasteful. The bed & bedding were so luxurious & comfortable. Bath, separate shower & toto toilet, double sinks, espresso machine, enormous Samsung tv & 2 armchairs fronting a superb view over the river. (We were told that soft drinks in the minibar were complimentary but on check out we discovered that wasn't the case.) The room was so quiet. We never had any sound from neighbours or from outside. We only had breakfast one morning as we checked out early the 2nd morning. There was a very small wait to be seated but the efficency of service, choice & quality of buffet were impressive.\n\nIt's a short easy walk to Gardens by the Bay. We also decided to do a river boat cruise & again it was just a short stroll to boat terminal outside the mall.\n\nHotel was a great choice for us in terms of location, quality & relaxation. We had dinner at Lavo (separate review to follow).",

A couple of days before we were due to arrive, we were contacted by the Premium Services team to ask if we wished to have a complimentary car pick us up. We took advantage of their offer. A driver was waiting for us at Changi airport and got us to the hotel. When we arrived, Frina, our private checkin person, was awaiting us along with a bellman to get our bags. We were whisked up to our suite (upgraded to the Paiza residences!) and we did the checkin inside the room. Frina could not have been friendlier or more professional. She is a great ambassador for the hotel. Once all that was taken care of, we enjoyed our five nights.\nIt's a hotel and mall complex, right next to Gardens by the Bay. So, if you don't want to leave the complex, you have all the food and shopping you need. If you do want to explore what Singapore has to offer (and of course you do!), you are really close to a metro station and you can go anywhere you want.\nYou're right next to Gardens By the Bay, so visiting it is really easy and convenient.\nWe had a buffet breakfast included in our meal; Rise is where the buffet is, and it has a great deal of various breakfast options for your dining needs. The lunch buffet is in the same place and has just as many options, including seafood.\nYour room key gets you free anytime access to the observation deck and infinity pool on the 57th floors. Take advantage of this; get on up there and enjoy the views. We hit the pool in the afternoon and found it easy to get a lounge. There are also jacuzzis up there.\nThe suite was spectacular; every modern convenience. The end tables had wireless charging units built in plus USB plugs. The bathroom has a bidet operated by a keypad. The shower has regular showerhead, horizontal showerheads and the rainfall showerhead. Jacuzzi bathtub, of course.\nGigantic TV in living room and smaller one in bedroom. Curtains (sheers and blackouts) operated by wall switches.\nThe staff; friendly, professional, courteous. Uniformly; every single staff member we encountered was excellent.\nSeriously, this was one of the best hotel experiencs we've ever had, and we would love to return to Singapore and stay here.",

        "review_text": "We stayed at Marina Bay Sands from September 17th to 19th. The 2 nights and 3 days at Sands Premier Suite, Gardens by the Bay View (King Bed) was really great, and I definitely want to come back again. During our trip with a 7 month old and a 27 month old, the Marina Bay Sands team was very considerate, which made our trip a happy one. On the last day, while going to the airport using the limousine service, we realized that we had left our first little boy's favorite pillow behind. When we were about to give up, the hotel delivered only the pillow through another vehicle, and thanks to that, our child was able to successfully complete the 7-hour flight. I can't forget the look of happiness on my son's face when he saw his pillow at the airport. I sincerely thank you for protecting my child's innocence and making good memories for our family. In particular, Jevic Navidad, who took care of our family at the airport and saw us off, and the driver (I don't know his name..) who contacted the hotel and worked hard to get us to the airport and receive the pillow, thank you very much. We made good memories, and we will definitely visit again. Thank you.",

Yes, it comes with a hefty price tag, but it delivers.\nOur experience begins at an extremely busy lobby, that somehow runs like a well oiled machine and we were speaking with reception staff within 2 minutes. We had the pleasure to be checked in by Katie (catiee ?) who I believe was on her first day at the job on 18/10/24. I hope this message reaches her, when we say that she was an absolute delight, really polite and really elevated our experience from the beginning.\nWe were then shown to our paiza deluxe suite on the 47th floor, and dear me...the room, the size, the design, the feel was just 6* experience. Everything in the room makes sense. Special things that were really standing out: 1. DIY tea ritual with high quality teas provided 2. high tech room controlled by tablet 3. smart TV in the bathtub room.\nAll in all, a hefty price tag, but definitely delivers in quality.\nWe would definitely return to stay, when back in Singapore !",

        "review_text": "In April of 2024, we visited the beautiful country of Singapore. We stayed at Marina Bay Sands and experienced their luxurious expansive resort for the first time.\n\nFrom the moment we checked in, their outstanding staff fulfilled every request from assisting with dinner reservations, city tours and even transportation to the airport. Marina Bay Sands’ exceptional service indulged our whims, surrounded us in tranquility, and provided us with endless opportunities to explore their magical one-of-a-kind world-famous hotel at our leisure.\n\nTheir attention to every detail ensured we experienced unparalleled comfort during our stay at this incredible haven of luxury, filled with stunning décor, and elegantly furnished rooms. Their infinity pool was sublime, with spectacular views of the city, and their restaurants' meals were decadent.\n\nKind regards to the dedicated staff that made our stay memorable, and a special thanks to; Victor Alexander Mai and Jeevan Rao, who were our first contacts with MBS staff and greeted us at check in. Victor also secured our dinner reservations at Spago, their rooftop restaurant, and escorted us to our table. Daniel Tuang, also greeted us at check in and provided us with a wealth of premium services information. Charmaine Ho had a lovely array of fruit, with champagne and an assortment of delicious chocolates awaiting us in our room. Aaron, one of the pool lifeguards, was kind enough to provide us with historical city information, and Mark scheduled our airport transportation and secured our luggage. Erica Gonzales met us at the departure exit to thank us and give us a warm farewell on behalf of MBS. Johnny, our friendly airport chauffeur, got us safely to the airport and radioed ahead so the amazing duo of Justine and Eric would be awaiting us curbside at the airport’s international terminal. They unloaded our luggage onto airport dollies, wheeled them to the baggage counter and escorted us to the VAT counter for our tax refunds.\n\nIn addition, the dynamic and kind team members from MBS’s housekeeping, restaurants and even the elevator operator, a friendly gentleman who whisked us to the front of the line when he saw that we were MBS guests, provided us with every conceivable comfort during our stay. Marina Bay Sands is rated as a 5-star hotel, but we wholeheartedly believe it should be a 10-star rating. Marina Bay Sands left us with beautiful memories, a deep appreciation for their incomparable superior devotion to excellence, and an embedded desire to return again and again.",

Daily breakfasts at the Rise restaurant were of high quality with many options across a variety of cuisines. And my jaw dropped the first time I entered the casino floor - it felt like I was in an opera house.\n\nI would particularly like to thank David and the entire Premium Services team for their care in assisting with my stay. I was surprised and delighted to have them organize airport transfers for me, and additionally received a bottle of champagne in my room upon check-in to celebrate my birthday.

The building itself is an architectural marvel and every touch point has been considered. The stars aligned and we were lucky enough to be upgraded to a Family Suite that had just been renovated. Needless to say our minds were blown! The views from the 47th floor were beyond spectacular and the suite was breathtaking. Every convenience was at our fingertips and the staff were so accommodating that they seemed to know what we wanted before we even wanted it! The rooftop pool is something everyone should experience at least once in their lifetime. It is truly like swimming in the sky. The pool staff were friendly, helpful and only too happy to go above and beyond to make our time as enjoyable as it could be. Spargo was fabulous and we enjoyed sun downers before heading back to our suite to watch the Gardens by the Bay light show. The buffet breakfast has to be seen to be believed - it was enormous and offered everything our hearts desired. We ventured into the shopping complex which was beyond my expectations. The food, the shops, the fabulous people wandering around were all so deliciously sumptuous. This truly is how the other half live! Thank you MBS for a life changing experience - it was everything and then some. A special shoutout to John and Charmaine from Premium Services who looked after us so wonderfully well.

We were so lucky to be given an upgrade to one of the newly renovated Paiza Collection suites on the 47th floor in Tower 1. There's aren't enough words to explain the luxury and extravagance of this suite. Water & city views overlooking the amazing light show at night, it was absolutely incredible. The shopping centre next to MBS is an experience in itself and everyone has to go there at least once. Highly recommend Spago for breakfast and definitely hit the pool for a late night swim - there aren't enough words to explan the views. Well worth the stay, will most certainly be back. Thank you so much MBS, you have no idea how much we appreciated the trip and it was worth every cent. Highly recommend everyone spends the extra $$$ and upgrades to a Paiza Collection room - it's worth it!

        "review_text": "We visited Singapore for a 2 night stopover after our fortnight of travelling around Lombok on a family holiday to celebrate my BIG birthday in August. As a surprise for everyone, I booked Marina Bay Sands, and it definitely did not disappoint. I booked 2 Sands Premier King rooms (one was upgraded free of charge to a suite for my partner and I), the newly renovated ones, and they were absolutely stunning. The attention to detail blew us all away, from the curtains opening automatically when the door to the room is opened, to the heated toilet seat and integrated bidet with warm water, the cocktails in the room, 2 huge TVs in our suite, fabulous views of the Gardens, the most comfortable bed we've EVER slept in, dressing area with lovely lighting, deep bath complete with bath salts and bath bombs...honestly, the list is endless. This was sheer luxury and we loved every minute of it. Despite there being renovation works at the hotel, we didn't hear anything, our room was really peaceful and we slept well. We spent a few hours by the iconic infinity pool, which really is stunning; we took advantage of the cocktails and snacks by the bar. This was a once in a lifetime experience for us and we absolutely loved it. The staff are superb, couldn't do enough for us. The only downside was the length of time we had to wait to check in at the desk. I'd tried to check in online, but the system didn't like 2 of our (older) UK passports. In no way, however, did this detract from the experience we had at Marina Bay Sands.",

After two weeks of contacting them they finally said they had my phone, then it was extremely difficult to get them to post it back to me, it was as if they just did not care at all and it was just a big bother for them, this is not a place you go if you want good customer service\n\n4werks later I still don’t have my phone",

The infinity pool is always amazing, and the staff always provide very attentive service.\n\nWe are looking forward to our next stay.\n\nKind regards\n\nRobert Patterson",

        "review_text": "As a cabin crew member who gets to experience different hotel stays around the globe I decided to treat myself a one night stay at the Marina Bay Sands and it didn't disappoint in any way.\nA personal big thank you to the upgrade and excellent staff in-particular Justin VIP check in desk, Rafeal infinity pool, Shivandasani infinity pool apologies if not spelt your name correctly and Madurai luggage.\nFrom the moment I arrived getting my key, was fast and efficient, luggage already waiting in my room. My room was amazing with Marina Bay Views. The bed super comfy and pillows, nice amenity kits etc plenty of complimentary water in the room with teas and coffee.\nRoom was quiet and well insulated....\nInfinity pool access with towels and water on hand. Staff really friendly and approachable used the outside jacuzzi eventually found the on button overlooking the Garden Bay ...\nEnjoyed my buffet breakfast, especially the cooked gammon slices, plenty of choices at Rise got there early morning as was told can get really busy and im sure it could be rather chaotic after 8am, as I arrived at 06:45 the only hiccup is I ordered another coffee and waited a while and went to ask another attendant who served it straight away.\nAfter checking out at 11 am I left my luggage whilst I did a bit of shopping MRT mega close by as shopping mall casino etc.\nOn checkout was giving a key to access the infinity pool which was nice.\nAll I can say from my own personal experience amazing 10/10 and the staff play a big part on first impressions and my overall experience was unforgettable, would return in the future\nThank you to all the staff and I appreciated my unexpected room upgrade... perferto!!!",

        "review_text": "Wow where to begin. Booked this back in may for my honeymoon.\nFirst issue it's getting renovated so it's half a building site and you can tell from the outside and the inside it's not subtle ( I checked beforehand).\nI booked a premium room with bespoke cocktails. Waited and waited for them to contact me regarding what I wanted in the armoire. Finally contacted them to find that this is now apparently an extra service fee on top of the room cost. Nothing but coffee is included. I spoke to lucas who told me I was paying for the convenience of the room. Well duh that's what rooms are for but I've never stayed in a suite or premium room where every facility given was then charged as extra.\nI then see that the price on the website is less than I paid way back in may. They wouldn't even take the difference off the room cost. No gesture of goodwill given.\nThe check in process is basically a circus we already gave our passport details but we're then warned there would be a huge queue which may take an hr or more. To check in! As a premium customer folks not the basic room. I then got warned of restricted pool times where u are counted in and queue again if it's full. So basically I decided I didn't want to stay in a hotel that was prepared to give me a sub par service add on costs and a them park style stay to possibly swim in the sky for 700 quid. So I cancelled and they waved the late cancellation fee tye only decent thing they could have done. I'm begging you do not wate a day of your life and your gard earned money on this cash cow it's not worth it !!! Stay anywhere else it will be better they will treat you nicer I promise",

Just too noisy!\n\nThe manager Victor apologize to us and showed us a new room. We had to pay upgrade fee but the room was 10000000% better than the previous room. And we learn that this is not the best room Marina Bay Sands can offer!\n\nVictor kept in contact with us during our stay and we are amazed with the hospitality which Marina Bay Sands has to offer. Marina Bay Sands was supposed to be our anniversary trip last spot before we flew back home, what we thought was going to be a nightmare became truly grand finale until the very end.\n\nThere was showering facilities available after check out which is good to have before our flight back.\n\nWe are still in touch with Victor and we are already planning for our trip back next year! Looking forward to have another grand time at Marina Bay Sands.",

        "review_text": "**Review for Marina Bay Sands, Singapore**\n\nMarina Bay Sands is, hands down, the best hotel I’ve ever stayed at! The service is impeccable—housekeeping is like magic; nothing is ever out of place, and the room is always spotless. It's like they sneak in and refresh everything without you even noticing! The rooms are fully equipped with everything you could possibly need, and the bed is extra comfy—you'll sleep like a baby.\n\nThe hotel itself is massive, and honestly, you never need to leave. It has everything—a huge mall, a casino, fantastic restaurants, and a sensational breakfast buffet that sets you up for the day. And of course, the highlight is the infinity pool. It's not only one of the best in the world, but also the largest. Taking a swim with a view like that is a once-in-a-lifetime experience.\n\nMarina Bay Sands truly has it all, making it by far the best hotel I’ve ever visited. A perfect stay from start to finish!",

The pool has awesome views over Singapore, but becomes very crowded.

We were sent to Tower 3 to check in. The loveliest receptionist, Alice, treated us so well that we were sent back to Tower 1 for our room. The room was out of this world. Spectacular is an understatement. We started to regret our short stay at the hotel. We also, couldn’t decide whether to spend more time in the room or at the rooftop pool. We reluctantly went up and had the time of our lives. Even though the pool was busy, it was somehow relatively calm. The view was mesmerising. It was the best 48 hours I have ever spent in Singapore. Guna, who jovially helped us at the pool is worth mentioning. Would go again..",

I’d heard good reviews but honestly I was so disappointed. £1200 a night I paid and after a long trip on the road I was presented with a mediocre room that wouldn’t be out of place in a Premier Inn. Supposedly a 5 star hotel, my mini bar had a can of coke and a can of sprite as well as juices - where was the beer or wine that most people look forward to consuming after a hard day and checking into a 5 star hotel. In addition, I was placed next to a busy road with no balcony and woken in the morning by drilling from the renovation works that were being carried out in the rooms above. The wider facility is impressive but there was no breakfast included and we had to walk across two towers to get to a facility that did serve it at $75 additional. Very disappointing and a real let down from the previous week and hotel standards.",

There are countless employees and everyone is well trained.\nWe don’t have to say anything about the rooftop pool, it’s looking for competition all over the world. Worth mentioning are the lifeguards, who do their job with a smile and joy, TOP.\nHowever, we would not go back to the hotel either, hence the review.\nWe have a room on the 2nd floor. The hotel was very clean and the staff were very helpful. In the room it smelled funny of drain and felt every 2 minutes there was a problem with the electricity (contact of the room card). We only used the room for sleeping, so we didn't intervene.\nWe then went to the roof, briefly enjoyed the spectacular view and wanted to reserve a table in the bar, but this was not possible with the staff on site. Later in the evening we learned at the bar that we could have made reservations online, which was not mentioned in the afternoon. Fortunately, we still found a table.\nThe next morning at sunrise by the pool there were still glasses from the previous day on the ground, which is definitely not befitting for a 5* hotel. For the first impression, the location and ultimately the price, you can expect more perfection.\nConclusion: spectacular hotel, with insane pool but \"the devil hides detail\".",

The service was fantastic beginning with our check in and escort to our room 3062 by Ms. Glaiza Gonzales who is wonderful hostess. The whole experience over our 7day stay was incredible. We enjoyed the shops and food offered in the hotel and at the shops. Would certainly recommend the MBS to our friends and coworkers should they elect to visit Singapore.",

Whilst we were out in the evening, staff went into our room and put bath mats down, slippers by our bed etc which is a lovely touch. The amenities in the room are great. Belinda on reception was so friendly and helpful and was so excited for us staying here for the first time. We had a gardens by the bay view which was brilliant! The rooftop pool is amazing, fantastic views and looks amazing at any time of day. All staff were so friendly. Would definitely recommend this hotel and would say it is worth every penny.",

        "review_text": "My sister and I returned to Singapore and Marina Bay Sands again this year, after the great visit last year, and this time for three days at the end of last August.\nIf last year I defined the hotel, and the experience of staying at the hotel, as a \"MUST DO\" when in Singapore, this time it can be doubled at least twice.\nFrom the moment we arrived at the hotel, to check-in, we were greeted by the wonderful ANDY Front Desk, Check-in, who did everything in his power, and even managed to upgrade the room we ordered (at an extra cost of course), so that we got a great room with a great view of the city on the 38th floor.\nThe room was very large with huge and luxurious beds that gave us a perfect and luxurious sleep.\nAGAIN, the bathroom was very spacious, with all the ordinary bathroom amenities, like toothbrush, toothpaste, etc. but in an enlarged size and branded for the Marina Bay.\nThe rooftop pool - the Infinity Pool - as usual is stunning in its beauty, and especially the view from it. This time unlike last year, and due to the extra time we spent at the hotel, we were able to take advantage and spend more time in the pool. Just pure pleasure.\nBreakfast at the RISE restaurant is a delight, with endless options. Starting with Chinese, Western, Indian cuisine and more. Simply suitable for every taste, in unusual abundance, and all in a pleasant atmosphere.\nI must mention Mrs. YIN LAY - the ROOM STYLIST, who took care of every shortage and every request we made to her. Just fantastic.\nAlso Mrs. TAN YA TING - Duty Manager, Front Office, who solved a problem that arose during check-out, quickly (so quickly, that I was amazed - even before we took off back from Changi) and efficiently, and all this in a humane and welcoming manner.\nHope, hope to come back soon again.",

They met us at the airport and had a car waiting for us, then escorted us to our rooms upon arrival -- no waiting at a check-in desk.\n\nThen, upon departure, they came to our room for check-out. After we stored our luggage with them and did some sight-seeing, they were waiting for us at the entrance to the hotel with a car, our bags already loaded. They escorted us to the airport, through check-in for our flight, and then on to the Jewel for some more sightseeing.\n\nThis kind of service is unparalleled -- an incredible treat. Pauline Alcazar and Mariella Manalang headed up the team and could not have been better -- they are amazing people. I hope I will see them again on our next visit to Singapore.\n\nAnd, of course, the Marina Bay Sands hotel itself is stunning. State of the art amenities, incredibly convenient, great room-service food, iconic rooftop pool.... Just a perfect hotel.",

I arrived at MBS at 11:30 AM and was not able to check in until 4:00 PM, despite the hotel's policy stating that check-in begins at 3:00 PM. When I contacted the Paiza hotline, the staff simply reiterated the hotel's check-in policy without offering any assistance or resolution. This level of service is unacceptable and falls below the standards expected of a five-star hotel.

Food and shopping also great. I would have put this as a five but our room was not great for the price we paid. On arrival we were told there was building work going on in the tower we stayed in. This was quite noisy and if I’d of known about this before hand, I might have tempted to upgrade my room to another tower. We were on the sixth floor and our room was next to the very busy road next to us. Very noisy. The air con in the room is also very loud. The bath room door is a sliding door and that clicks when you open it which disturbs the other person in the room. Whilst these are very minor things in an otherwise great hotel, it did affect our overall experience. If the room had been half the cost, I would not have been bothered but for the cost, I was a little disappointed. Overall though….very good",

We were celebrating our daughter’s birthday and a cake and birthday gift were organised for us, which was appreciated.\nOn departure we were given a complementary limo to our next destination and a late check out.\nWe had breakfast in Rise, which had an incredible choice.\nThe pool is everything you imagine it to be and more, the only down side to our stay was we left our room key and a watch on our sunbed while we were in the pool. Unfortunately when we got back to the sunbeds these were missing, the hotel did try and locate the watch but this was not found. It’s quite sad that someone would feel the need to take something that doesn’t belong to them, it just shows that even in a premius setting, this can still happen.\n\nWe requested a gardens by the bay view so we would watch the light show from the comfort out our room, this did not disappoint!",

Guest services organised our transfer from the city and when we arrived we were met by Eunice who took us straight to our room so that we could begin our journey. Eunice provided us with personalised check-in, very much appreciated and continued to provide welcome gifts throughout our stay. The pool is fabulous, hard to say anymore, and the poolside service is equally as good.\n\nWe dined both evenings at the roof top level, LAVO one evening and then Ce La Vi for the other evening. The total experience, food, service, and ambience are all superb. Although a totally different dining experience the breakfast in the morning was again fabulous.\n\nWe had thought that maybe Marina Bay Sands would be too opulent, however it was a super friendly experience. It is not the cheapest holiday that we have ever been on, but we recognise that it is a unique experience, particularly with the service provided by all staff, but we do need to mention Eunice who made our stay so match more enjoyable.",

        "review_text": "First thing first. This hotel is amazing and the facilities was excellent. What I do not understand is their claim that information of the renovation in the hotel is \"widely known\" and \"Highly advertised\".\n\nI mean like I have made my reservation for this hotel about one year ago and it was a big anticipated trip. with all the lights and hype going on. KC handled our check in and being nice. She informed us about the renovation works which caught us off guard. Renovation time is from 8am to 9pm!!!! I am here on a holiday not for a sound therapy which does not provide therapy or to be disturbed.\n\nNeedless to say we raised our concerns and a manager spoke with us and apologize saying that it was placed on Booking.com and on their website. I mean like when we booked it one year ago where was this placed? where was this mentioned? it was certainly not on the email confirmation we received and all the emails we have received from the hotel team. All they mentioned is we are all excited to welcome you for your stay with not one word of the renovation. We showed them all the emails and they agreed with us! This manager had the cheek to tell me there is nothing we can do as we are fully booked?!\n\nWe left the front desk unsatisfied and our room was under whelming apart from the wonderful view of Gardens by the Bay. We reasoned ourselves the mood was killed from our renovation surprise. The renovation works was tremendously impactful. It also shows that there are no sound absorbing layers between floors. Another manager call to apologize again and told us again there was no other room to change. This manager offered us SGD100 credits to offset our bill. We were insulted. The manager offered us SGD 100 for a 3 night stay here in this hotel. That was a joke.\n\nAt check out, we once again mentioned our situation and wanted them to proof where did they mentioned in the correspondence with us about the renovation works. They were unable to proof and only could show the current website information before anyone makes a reservation.\n\nWe have also written in provided this information on their hotel survey but there was no response from them. How typical. At least other hotels would have the courtesy to reach out to me.\n\nBut this is just my sharing. Good luck to all you folks out there and I bet you no one is going to respond to this. Share more and spread the word!",

        "review_text": "When it comes to luxury, this hotel certainly delivers. Although we experienced some miscommunication with a few staff members, Ms. Valerie from customer relations addressed our concerns effectively, making it likely that we'll return in the future.\n\nHowever, one aspect that needs urgent attention is the hotel's use of plastic water bottles. It's alarming to consider the environmental impact, with potentially thousands of bottles being discarded daily, forming what could be a literal mountain of waste. The justification that plastic bottles are the most practical solution is simply not acceptable, especially when other luxury hotels have successfully transitioned away from them without compromising their reputation or guest satisfaction. Given the premium rates this hotel charges, investing in more sustainable practices should be a priority.\n\nDue to this issue, I’m inclined to rate the hotel at one or even zero for now. Hopefully, they will reconsider their practices to align with the expectations of environmentally conscious guests.",

We also love our therapists, specifically Sand, who has been our therapist all this while. Lisa is really good too!\n\nWe love the calming vibes and the post-treatment treats and view. I highly recommend this place!",

        "review_text": "Visiting Singapore and staying at Marina Bay Sands has been on our bucket list for a few years now. We recently visited and we can say honestly that it did not disappoint. We love this hotel. Went with our two teen-age daughters. We had a beautiful view of the fountains and Burj Khalifa from our 17th floor balcony. Room accomdations were luxurious and roomy. We felt no detail was missed. Loved the comfiness of the beds, top notch linens and pillows. The Joe Malone co-branded toiletries were superb. The recent renovation came out really nice. We had a smart commode in our room that made even the \"daily duty\" a luxurious experience !!!! We ate at Spago up on the roof, both poolside and in the restaurant. Food was great - loved the spring rolls. The pool is the star of the show. A professional photographer appeared and offered to take some candids and we were glad we did! Another great thing about the hotel is location. You are right in the middle of the Marina section of downtown, making it walkable to the Flower Dome, Cloud Forest, the Super Tree Grove, Art/Science Center, and Lau Pa Sat (the oldest Hawker center in the city). Plus you have a world class mall attached to the hotel. The scents permeated throughout the hotel and with a perfect amount of balance.\n\nMy wife and I enjoy playing poker recreationally. I have never played poker in a casino so I thought I would it try it for the first time at this casino. It is a small casino, which for me was a great thing. If you are looking to play your first hand of poker in a casino I believe the last thing I needed was an intimidating casino floor. It is layed out with a nice flow - you cannot get lost in there - and the dealer who handled my table was a true professional who patiently got me up to speed on the difference between casino Texas Hold'em and the typical tournament style most people play at home. I was at a table with 3 Chinese nationals and they were a lot of fun to play with, everyone cheering each other on. I had a great experience in the casino.\n\nWe also ate at RISE for the buffet. This was a neat cultural experience as well. The food choices cover multiple culinary cultural specialities and all of the choices were a bit overwhelming. It does feel very busy in there. That being said, the staff was attentive there and the food was really good.\n\nWe absolutely will stay here again.. Primarily for the quality of the accommodations (post-renovation), location, the iconic pool (of course), the many dining options, and the luxurious feel of the entire experience there.",

        "review_text": "Staying here was a tough decision for us. It was our 40th wedding anniversary and we had stayed at MBS for one night 6 years ago. My wife and I were dazzled by the experience and so when we decided to celebrate our anniversary in Singapore, we wanted that same experience. However, the price had doubled since our last stay to nearly $1000 a night, so a three night stay would be nearly $3k!!\n\nBut the lure of the world's highest infinity pool and a huge room on the 57th floor like we had last time led us to book our stay. I made it a point to ask for a city view room on a high floor, but when we showed up, all they would do for us was a garden view on the 14th floor. Major disappointment! The front desk clerk took a whole half hour trying to search for different combinations, but unless I was willing to pony up another $9,000 a night, there was nothing she could (or would) do for us. We are not rich people but will splurge occasionally for something like MBS.\nOther than our disappointment, our stay was fine. The hotel is amazing. We spent much time in the pool and were able to watch the National Day celebration from the edge of the pool. So the decision is up to you, if you don't mind spending a lot of money for a unique, one of a kind experience, then this is the place to go.",

We felt amazing not needing to worry about how to get there or how to book a limo! with kids you know it's a bit of a hassle to do all those but like I said, David made our life sooo easy during our stay. No bias, but proud to be a Filipino because of people like him! I think they also arranged the beautiful set up for my daughter and it was unforgettable for her. She taught we did it for her as a suprise and thanked us. (so sweet) lol but really all of these things are not possible without the great staff of Marina Bay. So thank you!",

Views from the hotel are simply the best possible- you have to take Marina bay view room . Downstairs there is the best shopping mall in the Singapore as well as all of the restaurants. Walking distance to the Gardens by the Bay is 10 minutes so really comfortable. Weather conditions to travel around Singapore are not so comfortable so it is the best idea to be in the best possible spot .\nEverything else in this hotel is having nothing similar with the meaning of being LUXURY\nService is just horrible… but it is hard to expect anything else due to staying is such a large hotel\nOf course that I would came back as there are no other option",

It’s the hotel offers everything which makes the stay so easy and comfortable, there’s really no need to go very far as the hotel has it all. Great shopping, amazing restaurants, gardens by the bay. The service we experienced was great. We arrived early and left our bags to go exploring and they called us when our room was ready before the check in time.\nThe pool is the real highlight. The views are incredible. I wish they would section an area off as adults only though because there were children splashing around everywhere and it’s not what everyone wants. The pool area is so large they could easily have 2 separate areas. There is a separate children’s pool but the children were everywhere.\nWe stayed in tower 3. Our room was perfect, great view, luxury toiletries, cleaned really well. There are renovation works being carried out to tower 3 though so we were told there would be some noise in the day and we would need to access the pool from another tower. Accessing the pool from another tower was a bit of an inconvenience as we had to walk through the lobby in swimwear and go down to go back up etc. We were disappointed to be able to hear building works from our room as late as 8pm!! Whilst it didn’t ruin our stay the hotel could’ve done something to compensate for it such as a voucher towards drinks or a meal or something.",

        "review_text": "We stayed at Marina Bay Sands for the last night of our Singapore holiday as a treat. Wow! It was truly wonderful from start to finish. We didn’t leave the hotel for about 29 hours to make the most of it. Everything & all staff were 5 stars - from our very welcoming check in (with early check in!), pool wait staff, friendly life guards - all staff members. The rooftop pool was even better than we imagined and is open late for late night swim and more cocktails by the pool!\nOur highlight was the sunrise Sound Meditation with Karu - this was one of our best experiences ever. Karu has the most beautiful presence and the meditation and location was almost magical.\nWe were given late check out and that included day pass for facilities and a reserved shower room for one hour prior to departure - This was a hotel room without a bed, so we had a full bathroom with all amenities and empty room with luggage stands to re-pack our bags.\nI can’t say enough good things about our stay and will definitely be back again soon.",

The most spectacular thing is of course the infinity pool on the 57th floor that allows you to see incredible sunsets with the Singapore Sky Line.\nI had rewarded with breakfast option and I think it is the best thing, an incredible offer for all tastes and for all types of cuisine.\nThe rooms were very spacious, large bed, 100'' television, very large bathroom with huge bathtub shower and automatic bathroom!!!\nIn experience to try once in a lifetime given the fairly important cost!",

We would normally avoid hotels of this size at all costs, as they tend to lack the personal experience that smaller 5* hotels provide, but this couldn’t have been further from the Marina Bay Sands experience.\n\nFrom the moment we walked in the doors to when we left the next morning it was wonderful. The staff are the key to this hotel’s success: everyone we spoke to was lovely, very friendly, and helpful. Of particular note were the doormen Johan and Clyde, Julie Ann and Han on reception, and Ravi by the pool - all wonderful assets to the hotel. The staff all seem to go out of their way to be friendly and it made it such a lovely experience. Our room was upgraded upon arrival and we were given a gorgeous big corner room, with a view of both the city and the gardens by the bay - it was truly stunning, and had a massive balcony. The property is truly immaculate and once you get in the lift and go any floor above the lobby it is very quiet and private.\n\nNow for the pool - this is certainly the highlight, it is stunning, with very attentive staff. There are some stunning jacuzzis on the gardens by the bay side as well, and somehow the pool never feels too full of people. Overall, this hotel is worth the hype, and is totally worth the stay to have such a wonderful experience. An immaculate job has been done to create such a personal experience in such a large hotel, and I look forward to returning one day.",

        "review_text": "An absolutely enjoyable experience was had by us last night on the top of the Marina Bay Sands (MBS) hotel, tower 3\n\nMy wife was browsing for things to do while we were on a 4 night short stay in Singapore\nShe came across the Sunset In The Sky experience on the Sunset deck of MBS\nThe cost was $108 SGD each but don’t let that put you off of what it had to offer\n\nWe assembled at the lobby area of tower 3 then were met by Adam (who was our guide) explaining what the late afternoon & early evening entailed\nHe was very pleasant & relational making us feel quite at home\nAfter waiting a short time we were met by another 2 couples who joined us & then we were escorted through the crowd into a very fast but smooth moving lift.. that was quite amazing in itself! 😊\n\nWe had chocolate (very tasty & smooth), champagne (Pipers Brook Tasmanian) included in the ticket plus an excellent view of Singapore harbour & further afield\nAngel brought us the chocolates & wine making us feeling quite relaxed\nWe sat at a bar style round table watching the sunset then we were politely shown around the deck overlooking the Gardens By The Bay where a light show took place @ 7.45pm.\n\nEmily was our guide working in tandem with Adam who pointed out particular landmarks as well as being able to see a small portion of Indonesia’s land mass etc.\n\nAs the sun started to drop it became comfortable as there was a gentle breeze blowing around us & at the same time, lights on buildings, structures etc. were starting to switch on\n\nOur photographer (Amisur) (?)… sincerest apologize if I’ve miss spelt your name)) did a wonderful job taking pics & each of us received a mini album with different images to the other\n24 hours later we will be able to see all the pics online in a dedicated web portal\n\nFor further enjoyment to our experience, we were able to pick from a menu some eats & more drinks (of which we did)\nThe 4 of us in our group simply watched the harbour view quietly for quite a long time making us feeling quite relaxed.. very enjoyable \n\nAdam said we could stay there right up to 10pm. if we wanted but as great as the light show was & the harbour view, we were all a little tired after arriving into Singapore on the same day leaving there @ 8.30pm.\n\nHuge thanks again to Adam, Emily, Angel, Hooda & Amisir\n\nThoroughly recommend this experience when next in Singapore! 😊",

        "review_text": "This place is not cheap but that’s ok. You pay and hope to have some sense of…. Something worth the price/some value? Great check in experience, but the pre-experience should’ve been the red light- this place just wants your money. Let me count thy ways:\n\n1) When I booked the room, I paid the rate that would allow us to cancel. Then I got an email saying I couldn’t cancel. I screenshot what I saw and they screen shot the cancellation policy. Got it but they allowed me to book a room that says I could cancel.\n\n2) We learned we would be there during Singapore National Day, same day as my son’s birthday. I asked if the pool would be open or if I needed to pay extra to be at the pool. No clear response but basically, the response suggested I needed to pay extra. I did- at Ce La Vi. Early bird special. Told my college-daughter about it (BTW- we were in Singapore because she was there on internship) and she told het college-friends so we got more tickets! We were told (website and the many people we asked), come early- first come first serve. Got there early and then were told we could be there until they can sell the table. Why am I paying more and getting there early?\n\nThen, my kids were sent a different route and ended up at a different location, Observation Deck. They tried to order a drink and were told they couldn’t because they didn’t have the right ticket? What?! You directed us there!!!!\n\n3) Talked to the manager- he tried to make it right. Asked us what drinks we wanted and then asked us for our drink coupons that came with the purchase of the ticket. What?! I am paying for your mistake?\n\nCool place, but US-capitalism at its best. Made for Crazy Rich Asian for sure….",

Eunice went above and beyond to ensure our stay was special and seamless with a complimentary cake and champagne, booking car transfers for us with a car seat for our baby and even sang us a song on arrival. This was truly an experience we will never forget and are so grateful for. Thank you so much Eunice and Team ❤️",

I arrived at 3pm which was check in time and there was no room ready for us. After waiting in line for 10 minutes and then waiting another 35 minutes finally the customer services staff at the check in desk found a room for us. I was disappointed and frustrated that the room was not available at their advertised check in time.\n\nWhen we finally arrived at the room, the room smelled like a mix of perfume and cigarette smoke. I called front desk and asked for a room change but they said they will send housekeeping . Housekeeping came over with a machine that sprays perfume. I kindly informed the staff I don’t want more perfume. I don’t like the smell of perfume. I want a room that doesn’t smell like perfume covered smoke.\n\nNeedless to say this was a very disappointing experience after traveling 8 hours to get here to not have our room ready as advertised, and then worse to be stuck with a smokey room. This hotel is too big and not managed well based on my experience. It doesn’t live up to its hype or reputation to even provide the basic expectations of a clean smoke free timely delivered room. I would suggest staying at a different establishment.",

The beds and pillows were amazing and our youngest daughter absolutely loved the Casada massage chair, I think she would have slept in it had we allowed her.

        "review_text": "Pros:\n\n- Super convenient location. Walking distance (w/o leaving the hotel) to The Shoppes mall, Art & Science museum, Garden by the Bay. Amazing restaurants are at The Shoppe that we frequented daily - Ding Tai Fung, Yardbird, Milos, Toast Box to name a few. The hawker center was filled with amazing local foods & desserts.\n\n- Wonderful daily breakfast spot right by the MBS rooftop infinity pool. Free access to the observation deck.\n\n- The Sands family suite comes with unlimited free tickets to the Art & Science museum, sampan rides at the mall, digital light canvas etc. The kids room is equiped with a bunk bed, tv, magical wallpaper, books, backpacks & accesories, that kept our 2 & 6 yr old contented for the week.\n\n- To top it off, the Premium Services team, especially Charmaine was amazing and made our stay at MBS pretty amazing! She took the time to show us different room options that we could upgrade to, addressed any concerns that we had, and came up with a curated list of kid friendly spots for our kids to visit, made the time to have a friendly chat with us about living in Singapore as we chatted about how culturally different our countries were. Charmaine definitely made our family feel well cared for during our stay at MBS.",

        "review_text": "I never usually write reviews but felt I had to after our stay at marina bay sands.\n\nWhat can I say other than this place is amazing and we were so well looked after.\n\nWe arrived early at 10.40 and from the start we were treated like royalty, our doors to taxi were opened and our luggage swiftly taken away and looked after until our rooms were ready. We were there shown to the front desk to check in.\n\nWe stood in a very short queue to check in, and a kind gentleman (I’m sorry I can’t remember his name) took us to the vip booth, where we were given premium treatment, and check in was quick and they found us a room that was ready, so we could take advantage of the facilities sooner. We were shown to our room by frina who was so kind, and welcoming. She showed us to our room and explained how everything worked, she asked us if we were celebrating anything special and I told her we were celebrating my son’s 16th birthday.\n\n10 minutes after she left we received a call from her, to let us know that she had arranged afternoon tea, which was complimentary and had also arranged for a complimentary transfer to the airport when we check out in three days time. This was so thoughtful, so imagine my surprise when after a swim we returned to our room and there was a plate of chocolates and balloons, we are not used to this kind of treatment and were really taken aback and we felt so special.\n\nThe hotel itself is nothing short of amazing, our room overlooked the gardens of the bay and we saw the light show every night. We had robes and slippers and lots of bathroom essentials. The bed was comfy and we also had a put up bed for our son and still had lots of room. The mini bar was stocked with soft drinks and snacks and replenished daily.\n\nWe had access via wats app to frina who booked restaurants for us and was accessible for all of our other needs.\n\nWe had breakfast every day at origin and bloom which is the coffee bar and Jon was an absolute sweetheart, he remembered all of our names and our orders including how I liked just a dash of milk in my tea. This was very impressive and it’s little touches like this that make you feel special.\n\nNow on to the best bit, the infinity pool is the main reason we splashed out on this hotel, it did not disappoint. It is magnificent and the view is outstanding, it wasn’t too busy and we spent a lot of time here. You do not need to worry about towels, suncream or water as it’s all provided as you walk in. There are plenty of beds around the pool, not once did we ever have to get up early and reserve a bed like we have in previous hotels. There are poolside waiters who bring you drinks, a big shout out to Chenna, like Jon he remembered the drinks we liked and our names 😊\n\nOur flight was not until 11pm, so I enquired about a late check out and we were able to stay until 1pm which again was complimentary, so we spent the morning making use of the pool. When we then had transport back to the airport, Charlie was our driver he was hilarious and made the sad journey to the airport (we didn’t want to leave) funny. We were then greeted by a lovely lady (again sorry can’t remember her name) who took use through the airport and helped with checking in and taking us the the correct terminal.\n\nWe are a normal family, who work hard, we are not used to staying at luxurious hotels and saved up for a long time to stay at MBS and I have to say it’s one of the most memorable experiences at a hotel and it was worth every single penny. Thank you to all of the staff at MBS for making us feel special and making our stay one of a lifetime.\n\nIf you are thinking of staying do not hesitate to book, you will not regret it 😊",

Cheers to all of you!\n\nIn one evening, we went to Spago for dinner and to catch up with some friends who lived in Singapore. We dined at the Spago Lounge and met Riza who take cares of us. Riza was so nice to us that evening and she even suggests what are the best dishes to try as this is our first time. Thank you Riza for your service and taking care of us on our table. Kudos to you!

The highlight of our stay was the infinity pool on the 57th floor of the hotel. It was amazing! Even though the hotel itself has a staggering 2,600 guest rooms, we\ndid not feel that it was crowded. We had enough space to swim and lounge around. And another thing, we did not have to go far to explore our “must-see” attractions list during our stay since the hotel was centrally located. Gardens by the Bay nightly light show was just around the corner from the hotel, as well as the Art Science Museum. The hotel staff was also wonderful and friendly.\nThe only negative experience I had was at the Food Hall in The Shoppes of the hotel. I ordered food at Rasapura food court, and I had to question my bill with the cashier because she was overcharging what I ordered. She knew I was not a local resident and overcharged me.\nOverall, my hotel stay was excellent and I would stay here again on my next visit to Singapore.",

From the moment we were picked up by the hotel transfer, to the time we were dropped back to the airport, our experience transcended expectations.\n\nOur trip was for our 20-year anniversary which was a very special event in our lives. The MBS staff made the stay so memorable and extremely romantic. From the decadent food to the alluring cocktails, the staff’s attention to detail and willingness to proactively plan events to enhance an array of unforgettable moments cannot be understated.\n\nA special thank you to Paul and Danial from the butler team who made our stay so pleasurable. They catered to our every need and made our special anniversary trip opulent and sublime. Both Paul and Danial extended us every bit of courtesy, care and customisation to make the holiday distinct.\n\nSue in the Sky Residence took very good care of us during our dining experiences. In fact, Daniel and his entire team in the Sky Residence were a delight and treated us like family.\n\nCarmichael is a master of cocktails and an artist when it comes to bartending. His magnificent imagination and creativity in making creative cocktails was only matched by his kindness and friendly nature.\n\nThe massages with Jane and Lisa were heavenly. A thank you to Shirely for the amazing poolside service. Robby was wonderful with assisting us at the airport.\n\nTruly, every staff member we came in contact with was fantastic. You have such a remarkable team, and we cannot wait to return. We cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. The staff have truly created an immeasurable experience for us and lifelong unbeatable memories.\n\nOther notable staff included Grace, Audrey, Joel, Vella, Ella, Anthony, Camilla and Hua Yi.

        "review_text": "Only booked here for a recent three day stay in beautiful and clean Singapore because my wife insisted. I was sure this was an overpriced tourist trap, based solely on word of mouth. Boy was I wrong.\n\nFirst, we booked the Sands Premier Room with breakfast, which I fully expected to be on a low floor with a view of a retaining wall, but imagine my surprise when we arrived at fabulous Changi and upon clearing customs, were greeted with a person with my name on a sign. Turns out the hotel had arranged a complimentary car service for us to the hotel. Wow.\n\nUpon arrival at the hotel (which is as dramatic a building as you will ever see), we had a personal greeter to give us in room check-in services, Double wow. Upon entering the room, we found it was on about the 23rd floor as I recall, facing Gardens by the Bay (which I actually prefer), with a view extending on to the Straits of Malacca, and had a wonderful veranda with beautiful vegetation and a large sitting area. Also welcoming us were a bouquet of flowers, chilled bottle of champagne (which we didnt drink) and chocolates and fruit. All because I had mentioned at booking that it was our anniversary. I’m nobody special either, but I truly appreciate the unbelievable hospitality we were shown. Triple and Quadruple wow.\n\nThe room itself was stunning. In Tower 1 so I cannot speak to the ongoing construction that may affect Tower 3 where the entry level rooms are but ours was obviously renovated and had an outstanding bath, with double vanity and a comfortable bed along with a free rollaway bed for our son. Total luxury all around, including automatic curtains, japanese toilet, bath salts for the luxurious tub, amazing bath robes and a leather covered safe.\n\nI was leery about the rooftop pool as I thought it would be an overcrowded nightmare, but contrary to that belief, it was incredibly manageable, especially in the mornings when there were very few people there. I note that Tower 1 entry to the rooftop pool uses the Lavo elevator bank whereas I believe Tower 2 and 3 use the opposite side of the hotel’s elevator banks so the Tower 2 and 3 side seemed more crowded when we were there. Also, Spago sort of cuts the pool area in half so people tend to stay on their side of the rooftop pool.\n\nThe breakfast at Spago on the roof was ok, not great. Limited options but the service was friendly and nice and the atmosphere and views cant be beat. That rooftop is just plain gobsmacking all around. The breakfast service at Rise on the ground floor, however, which we sadly tried only once was nothing short of fantastic.\nPerhaps the best breakfast buffet I have ever seen outside Italy. Amazing, fantastic and exceptional.\n\nThe hotel is attached to an incredible mall and also has a casino. Also has great access to the MRT and from our balcony we watched the GBTB light show. Just a one of a kind experience and I was truly amazed to find that all my fears about being duped into an overpriced hotel were so far from reality that I felt embarrassed that I ever thought that. This is one of those hotel experiences that you just dont care about what you spent because it is truly that, an experience. Thank you Marina Bay Sands staff for being so kind and exceptional.",

        "review_title": "Speaking of Singapore, MBS",
        "review_text": "Speaking of Singapore, I think MBS is the only one!\nI've been inquiring from time to time for quite some time about staying in a good room, and I felt like the Paiza room at the top was quite controlled, like it was for big guests in a casino. (The reservation people were going to check with someone and didn't give an immediate answer about their availability. We were not casino guests, we just wanted to stay.)\n\nIn May (not Golden Week), the three of us stayed four nights in a dual view room with two bedrooms and two baths, which cost around ¥740,000 a day, including the paiza sky residence. Around 5 years ago the orchid suite dual view (which at the time had lounge access in this class) was around 230,000 per night (although it was a bit lower than the paiza floor and a one-bedroom suite), so I thought it was quite expensive. It was a double punch of inflation & yen depreciation.\n\nIn the lounge, food used to be snacks like sandwiches and canapés, but in the evening, the food is authentic and becomes a proper dinner. On the other hand, the afnun is fixed, so I get tired of being the same every day.\nThe seats were more spacious than before, and I felt like I could take my time.\nIt is now only available to people in paiza rooms.\n\nI wasn't sure if it was for heavy guests at the casino, or if it would automatically follow me if I stayed in my paiza room, but there was a private immigration service at Changi Airport called Jet Quay that put it on for me (they told me it was going to be made or I couldn't, but it did eventually). When we get off the plane, the buggy will be waiting for us and it will take us to a different place from the other guests and we have our own immigration officer. I checked in with zero wait time and was relaxing in the lounge, and someone had saved my luggage for me, and Alphard was waiting right outside the lounge (the fat guest was apparently a Rolls-Royce) and the attendant put my luggage in Alphard. Total stress zero. I went there by ANA, but a lot of other passengers kept coming down from the gates around me, and I wondered what would have happened if I had just gone through immigration normally. Even on the way back, the ANA gate was the furthest away, and they took me to the gate in a buggy, which helped a lot. (They said I could apply directly, maybe $350 per person.) By the way, if you want to see jewel falls, JAL is probably closer.\n\nThe paiza room comes with a butler, and I thought it might be good if people wanted us to serve them in a variety of ways, but the sense of distance and communication was difficult. The official language seems to be English, but I don't feel very native, and there have been a few occasions where I've been frustrated by not being able to get it across, depending on the person (we've lived in the US in the past). But I felt a willingness to cover my mistakes.\nI was making a Reservation for breakfast at 8 o'clock and got a phone call at about 7:35, and I was like, I'm coming to pick you up, and I'm kind of hectic right now. If you are someone who can do a lot of things on your own to a certain extent, I think there are moments when you feel a little unnecessary.\nIf you ask them, they make tea for you and put hot water in your bath.\n\nThe infinity pool was so crowded that there were cabana seats reserved for paiza, which was great, but the rest of us wandered around looking for seats.\n\nThe room was great to see both sides of the city and sea, and the shows on both sides, including the Garden by the Bay side.\nIt was convenient to just put the iPhone on the side table and charge it (maybe just paiza). Karaoke was included.\nCleaning was normal, but there were three TVs and one remote was out of battery.\nThe phones were all cordless, and when I talked to Mr. Butler for a long time, the battery seemed to run out, but the hotel said they wanted to do something about it.\nI asked for a turndown and they did it normally (though I didn't really need one).\nCleaning clothes comes with two free clothes a day.\nYou can also have three meals if you substitute Afnun for lunch,\nIncluding the above airport transfer and private entry and exit services\nOverall, I didn't think it was really expensive.\nIn Japan, for example, at the Bougari Hotel, it might be cheap to watch a small room cost 300,000 yen a night, or a two-bedroom room cost 1.2 million yen just to stay.\n\nThey made restaurant Reservations, but they also made Reservations for TWG Gardens, which they said were not normally available.\n\nOn the way home, I think it was between 7am and 7am.\nThere were about 30 people, butlers lined up, waiting for the big guests to arrive and it was spectacular. It was like coming in a big Rolls Royce.\n\nEven in Japan, there is the idea of a casino, but Japan has a poor or petty side to everything, and there is a strange tendency to seek equality, so I thought, can we provide a service that satisfies VIPs around the world? (I don't think it's easy to have an immigration office like Haneda Airport where only rich people can go first.)\n\nI hear that a fourth building will be built next to MBS, which may change the landscape. I think he said there were about 500 rooms all in suites.\n\nDoes communication happen sometimes? It was good except for this.",

The pool made the process of the stay worth it because being able to relax and swim at the top of MBS was a bucket list item for us. The staff was very helpful and the hotel didn’t feel overly crowded. The gym was also very nice and one of the nicer hotel gyms I have seen.

        "review_text": "“Just Wow!”\nStayed for one night at the Marina Bay Sands. Here is a summary of our experience: We were welcomed right when we stepped out of our ride by Jet. JET was so welcoming and friendly. He took our luggage and asked if this was our first visit to the hotel. He gave us a mini verbal tour as he lead us to the reception area where we were welcomed by Patrick. PATRICK (he calls himself trouble. Lol!) made sure we weren’t bored as we waited our turn to check in at the front. He was amusingly entertaining and kind. He lead us over to Nicole. NICOLE was so pleasant and made suggestions as to what we can do for the evening and explained where all the facilities around the hotel were. We got an unexpected upgrade to a higher floor! Thanks Nicole! We did a little walkabout before we headed to our room which was spectacular! Our view was the waterfront and the light show. Amazing! YEZAR brought our luggage up and you can tell that he’s a “people person.” Such a pleasant man and let us know that if there was anything we needed to just contact him. The infinity pool up on the 57th floor is nothing like what we’ve experienced! Just fantastic! Service all around was outstanding. We weren’t sure what to expect from this hotel. Staying at the Marina Bay Sands was part of our bucket list but I think we are ready to go back again for a longer period. All the hype about this hotel is more than expected! Thank you to the staff! Can’t wait to visit again!\n06 Jul 2024",

        "review_text": "My wife and I had our wedding party at Sands Expo and Convention Center during the end of June.\n\nMarina Bay Sands was our top choice for location, status, service and quality. But the winning factor to make it the top event location in Singapore is their service team, especially when we were assisted by events executive, Suhana Sudil.\n\nWe did not had an easy start as the previous event manager left the team and her service quality was honestly, not the best. Basically, it was hard to talk to her after we signed the contract (a nightmare for all wedding couples). But Suhana turned the tables around.\n\nSuhana was very understanding to our needs to help make our event a unique one for not only us, the couple, but the guests as well. As newly weds, we do not know what to expect, weeks before the wedding, she went the extra mile to explain to us what to expect and run us through the event. She couple easily point out the blind spots we missed out and help to fill in the gaps perfectly.\n\nPersonally, i've ran events in many Singapore event spaces and hotels due to my work requirements and i know what it is typically like to run an event. However, the intangible service quality she delivers is a rare gem to find.\n\nOther than her own delivery, she is able to concert the entire team, including security and banquet to help out. This is true leadership at display.\n\nMy wife and I were overwhelmed by the praises of the event space and this has to be the best effort of Suhana and her team. We would like to sincerely thank Su and her team in making our wedding a memorable one.\n\nThank you,\nRyan",

Check in was 3pm but we arrived at 2pm and reception provided two temporary passes to access the facilities at the hotel such as the Infinity Pool on Level 57, which is only accessible for hotel guests.\n\nReception then emailed us just before 3pm to inform us that the room was ready and surprisingly, upgraded us to a suite in Tower 3. The room was stunning, with 2 balconies, one with seating for 4 the other with seating for 8. A large living area and entrance hallway. Bathroom had a shower, bath tub and his/hers sink along with branded toiletries. The minibar is stocked and replenished daily free of charge and the hotel also provided us with 8 bottles of water.\n\nWith a birthday celebration planned, the hotel left an individual cake in the room which was a brilliant gesture. The cake was delicious as well!\n\nWe visited the infinity pool each morning at 6am to take in the sunrise and enjoy the pool whilst it had fewer patrons. Towels are provided when you access the pool and sun beds are on a first come first served basis (same for day beds although premium guests can reserve these I believe).\n\nThe hotel staff are all pleasant and polite in every aspect and this clear that this is a professionally run hotel with a passion for quality and standards. The hotel lobby is close to the Bayfront MRT station and the Shoppes at MB are easily accessible as it is adjacent to the hotel.\n\nOverall a fantastic first time visit and one that we have every intention of making again soon.\n\nThank you MBS for a memorable stay!",

That aside, the room was comfortable, the staff were polite and the amenities were great. I recommend using the infinity pools at sunrise as the space is next empty and the views are phenomenal.

This could create a wonderful opportunity for families to enjoy wellness together, fostering both health and stronger relationships.\n\nThank you so much for considering this suggestion.

        "review_text": "I stayed in Singapore for four nights. My friends and I flew from America and South Korea to reunite (a 22 hour flight for me). We stayed our first three nights at Oasia Downtown (which was phenomenal) and splurged for a room at Marina Bay Sands on our final night.\n\nI upgraded our room to premier specifically for the view—paying around $1500.00 for what was supposed to be a special night with friends. Unfortunately, my stay at MBS was the worst lodging experience we had while in Singapore.\n\nUpon arrival, an employee of the hotel by the check-in line asked me and my friends if we were Deluxe (the cheapest rooms) or Premier. I told him, “I’m pretty sure we’re Premier, but I’ll check my reservation.” His response, “I’m pretty sure you’re Deluxe.” I showed him my reservation confirmation, Premier. He said he was sorry and walked away from the area before I could catch his name. This man made a value judgement upon looking at us, and it was insulting.\n\nThen, our room was not ready at 3:30pm (30 minutes after check-in). We asked the hotel to store my friend’s insulin in a refrigerator until our room was ready as this was time sensitive—and keeping her insulin cool a must. We were told our only option was to accept a room on the 8th floor if we needed to store the insulin right away. We had no choice.\n\nThe view was not what we payed for, and it was extremely disappointing. Additionally, guests at the hotel made status judgements of me when getting off at the 8th floor. I was literally called poor. For $1500 for one night, we were looked down upon by guests and staff alike.\n\nI messaged the hotel, and I did not hear back from them until late at night, saying our room was technically premier (in spite of being on one of the lowest floors). While they admitted they handled the situation poorly, they did nothing to rectify the situation.\n\nWas the view from the pool nice? Sure. Was the hospitality of the staff or the accommodations worth $1500? No. Marina Bay Sands is all hype. Save your money. I highly recommend Oasia Downtown, where staff are friendly and accommodating.",

On top of this, there was constant drilling from construction work during the day which I only found about upon arrival. Really think they should have offered a discount as a result.\n\nRoom was nice with a great view of the city below.

My girlfriend and I really appreciate everything she does from picking us up at our limousine service to escorting us to our room, she explain and showed us around the room with great spirit and wonderful energy.\n\nHonestly, there is nothing negative about the overall experience even the in-room dining timing are accurate. It is first class hospitality and I will definitely return back to celebrate another special occasion.\n\nThank you team MBS for everything and Thank you so much Eunice from Premium Services Team. 💕",

        "review_text": "The Marina Bay Sands is not just a hotel, but an experience and a tourist magnet. The room furnishings and especially the size of the room (approx. 47 sqm) is phenomenal. The view of the port of Singapore and the “Garden by the Bay” is sensational. There is even a small balcony on the 44th floor. A huge flat screen TV in the room. It was the biggest I have ever seen in a hotel room. We didn’t use it though, there is so much else to see.\nThe design throughout the hotel is an eye-catcher.\nCountless restaurants in the lobby but also in the mall on the lower floor. The shops there are all luxury brands and therefore expensive. There is a casino, a small waterway where you can sail in a gondola and of course endless opportunities to invest your money in luxury labels.\nThe hotel also has its own “MRT” station and you can walk directly from the hotel to the Gardens by the Bay. The hotel is very spacious but there are hardly any stairs, so it is very suitable for people with limited mobility.\nOur \"check-in\" was by far the best I have ever experienced in a hotel. Although we were not VIPs, we were taken from the \"normal\" check-in queue to a VIP check-in lounge and were served by a wonderfully friendly employee.\nService is impeccable and always very friendly in all 5* hotels in Singapore. The Marina Bay Sands is no exception. Then of course there is the spectacular pool that you can hardly get enough of. And right next to the pool are various \"Spago\" restaurants and a bar that is more casual.\nAs the hotel is an attraction in Singapore, there are a lot of people there who want to admire this attraction and use the restaurants even if they are not hotel guests. This leads to very impersonal mass processing and limited times for a stay in the restaurant (max 1 hour in the bar with drinks and food).\nThe rush of tourists probably just cannot be managed any other way.\n\nThe lobby is also incredibly busy and is more reminiscent of a shopping center (which actually starts one floor below) than a hotel lobby. We had booked without breakfast and when I went to the lobby the next day, there was a long line in front of the restaurant, everyone waiting for breakfast. I was glad that I didn't have to wait another hour for my breakfast for the price of €50 per breakfast.\nAll in all, the Marina Bay Sands is an experience and if you are in Singapore and have the opportunity, I would definitely recommend it for one or two nights. Actually a bit of a \"must have\" in Singapore but you should be aware of what you are letting yourself in for.\nIf you prefer a more personal atmosphere, you should stay somewhere else. Pretty much everything in the complex is also very expensive. Except for the \"MRT\" station.",

None the less just made it awkward to get to the pool - maybe a cocktail or breakfast would have been nice as a gesture.\n\nThe disappointing part is a top went missing on my stay.

        "review_text": "Was a really good Hatha yoga session first thing in the morning at 730am on observation deck at MBS.\nShe did a really good session, calming, gave different level options. Only reason for not 5 stars is because the sun got too hot by 8am. If recommend to do class earlier just so the sun isn't too hot on our face. Or maybe suggest for class to turn around away from the sun would be helpful. But apart from that is was a lovely session. Thank you 💛 🙏",

        "review_text": "We were there as a family in April. The hotel is very impressive, but despite the many guests, everything is fairly well organized.\nWe found it very disappointing that we didn't get the rooms that we had booked through Booking.com and paid significantly more for. We really wanted to be on the 40th floor, but we were booked on the 18th floor because there was no other option.\nThe rooms themselves were very nice.\nBreakfast was an additional 50 euros per person, it was very plentiful, but the price was still excessive.\nThe pool on the roof was breathtaking, the view was unique!!!\nFor dinner, there was a buffet in the main restaurant for 130 euros (!!) per person, which the four of us didn't spend. The restaurant situation in the hotel was a bit difficult overall, so we always ate outside in the evenings.\nOverall, it was nice to have seen the hotel!!",

Either the processes are too cumbersome or the staff is very slow but it takes ages for everything. The net result are tens of minutes spent queuing, I experienced it myself, with just two employees at the desk and two people ahead of me.",

The view looking over the Marina Bay and the skyline of Singapore was just something to behold day and night. We stayed in a Sands Premier Suite City View, (tower 2 in the middle). The Suites are incredible, so beautifully designed, so much space, attention to detail with class and luxury while remaining comfortable cosy and homely. Staying at Marina Bay Sands also affords you the ability to use that glorious roof top pool while sipping on drinks and eating food. The staff are beautifully friendly and just complement the building and surroundings. The shopping below is fantastic and so are the many many restaurant options. We ate at KOMA and thoroughly enjoyed every flavor presented. We also enjoyed sunset at the Cé La Vi Skybar. Spago and Lavo are also on the rooftop and look amazing so we will be dining there next time. Having the Marina Bay Gardens on the other side of the hotel is super convenient. After visiting the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome you can catch the Supergrove Rhapsody light show and then head back to the city side and watch the Spectra light and water show and when the legs are weary just head upstairs to your room. Marina Bay Sands is definitely a place we hope to come back to.",

But he was the one who assisted us from the queue (even called my daughter Cinderella). He advised us to proceed to the office to assist us with our check-in.\n\nJason - didn't get the chance to ask for his surname but he was the one who assisted us on our check-in. He explained clearly all the things that we need to know that would help us to have a comforting stay.\n\nA very warm and kind lady - while I was talking to Jason, this fine lady accommodated us specially my daughter and even gave her a coke and lollipop. It really made my daughter's mood up high. Not because of the sweets though, :) but because of the kindness that this fine lady gave her. Maybe Jason can give her name :)\n\nHill - when it was our time to get our key cards, she was the one who assisted us. She was warm and all smiles while completing our check-in procedure.\n\nRaymond (GSA - Bell) - upon our checkout, we left our luggage at the storage and Raymond warmly helped us with it.\n\nIn general, everyone was very accommodating and warm. From the time we arrived up until we left. It was really a memorable and the happiest vacation me and my daughter had.\n\nEverything inside the room exceeded our expectations: space, bed, complimentary stuff, bathroom, powder, TV... EVERYTHING!\n\nI'd like to end this email with a huge thanks for upgrading our room. It doubled the fun and happiness of my daughter. Many many thanks and hope to stay with you again.\n\nMore power!",

        "review_text": "To stay or not to stay? Let’s check it out!\n\nFor no doubt, Marina Bay Sand Hotel is not only one of the most famous hotels in the world, but also an iconic landmark of Singapore. The innovative design of the three extraordinary towers combined with the infinity long pool makes the hotel a very impressive architecture — a true futuristic theme which epitomizes Singapore’s modern elegance and sophistication. The magnificent pool which stands on the 57th floor is what the hotel known for. It’s renowned for the stunning and phenomenal views which your excitement has no end in sight. I started my day early morning there to enjoy the urban oasis of tranquility (for check-in guests only).\n\nOn the other hand, the prime location and the hotel amenities make Marina Bay Sand Hotel a perfect place for a vibrant city life and the legendary nightlife. The hotel is accessed to the lobby with all luxury shopping brands, a 24-hr casino, an exclusive nightclub and Bayfront MRT station — everything metropolitans call for.\n\nThe greenery Gardens by the Bay (my favorite place in Singapore— a sanctuary of the bustling part of the city), which is just right behind the hotel, is my another reason to stick with MBS. The observation deck and the roof bar in the hotel brought me mind-blowing experiences by overlooking some of Singapore’s most captivating views and the stunning light shows. They are just breathtaking and panoramic!\n\nBack to square one, to stay or not to stay at Marina Bay Sand Hotel? The main reason for most visitors to choose this hotel is because of the most incredible swimming pool in the world and which makes everything worth. You can simply make your reservation for just a day and make a balance by having cheap eat or finger food since food in Singapore is mouthwatering! However, if you’re not a swimming person you can totally skip it. You can easily buy a ticket to the observation deck or enjoy drinks in the roof bar without spending a fortune. Still, top-notch ambiance!\n\nI’ll come back again :)",

Her attention to detail , her genuine passion, enthusiasm, and her professionalism truly exceeded our expectations. We felt welcomed and valued as guests. Our suite was impeccably clean, and every detail was carefully curated to ensure highest comfort and relaxation thanks to the hard work and dedication of Ms. LAI POH.\nThroughout our stay, the entire client experience team demonstrated professionalism and efficiency. The team takes great pride in providing excellent service from restaurant recommendations to arranging transportation. We truly felt well taken care of. We were very touched by the gift and the beautiful handwriting thank you card from Ms. EUNICE when we checked-out.\nUnlike most hotels, the excellent service didn’t stop once we left the Marina Bay Sands. We appreciated their final touch service transportation to Changi airport. Mr. FRANCIS was booked for driving us. He was extremely polite, wonderful and friendly. When we got there, we met Mr. ROBBY who helped us with luggage as well as registration at the ticketing counter. He did not leave our side until we were all checked in and ready to leave. Now that’s service!\nWe thank EUNICE, LAI, FRANCIS and ROBBY for making our time in Singapore absolutely unforgettable. Our stay at the Marina Bay Sands was extraordinary and we cannot wait to return.",

Our luggage was securely stored and we were given a pass for the pool so we could use it straight away. When our room was ready we were sent an email to let us know. We had a room overlooking the Gardens by the Bay and the Harbour, which was a spectacular view. The hotel sent up a birthday cake to our room, and we had another birthday cake when we ate at Lavo.\n\nEvery member of hotel staff greeted us warmly and the housekeeping is the best we've ever encountered. Every day our room was tidied including our cables being stowed away with MBS cable ties!\n\nWe had breakfast every morning at the roof top restaurant which was lovely. The food was good and the view outstanding.\n\nThe only slight niggle was when we went up late evening to the roof top bars for our last night and found it packed with non residents, meaning we had to queue to get a table. That said, when the staff recognised that we were residents we were seated more quickly than non residents. A minor frustration and to be expected in such a iconic hotel.\n\nAll in all a wonderful experience.",

        "review_text": "First of all, many thanks to the VIP service and the concierge service staff, who looked after us wonderfully over the three days.\nWe were among those who suffered most from the storm in Dubai and had to spend our stay at the MBS WITHOUT our suitcases.\n\nWe have already visited many first-class hotels, but even a comparison with the \"Fairmont The Palm\" is not accurate. The MBS is in a class of its own, especially with the pool.\n\nAlthough we only got to the pool in the afternoon, we got loungers right by the pool. The \"best\" is the pool in the evening. Wonderful, lying in the water and looking out over the city.\nThe service at the pool is a bit slow, but that's OK. We are on vacation and not on the run.\n\nThe room - we were on the 18th floor, with a balcony and a view of the \"metal forest\" - was also amazing.\nThe room furnishings, especially with the bathroom, which is a bit old but very well maintained, the bar and also the cocktails in the room, are good. But chairs with a small table on the balcony would not be a bad idea.\n\nIn the evening we ate at the Italian restaurant, Lavo, with a view over Singapore, woh. The food is very varied and of high quality. The service is also very good.\n\nAs we were only at the MBS for three nights, we were unable to visit the other restaurants, we only went to Blossom, which is also recommended.\n\nDuring the day, the lobby resembles an anthill. It only gets quieter from around 10 p.m. This is also the time when you can visit the \"Renko Bar\" without stress and noise. Here too, the service is very good. We drank several of the cocktails, not bad.\n\nBut there is also one point of criticism concerning the breakfast.\nThe breakfast is generally extensive and very good, but for guests who don't eat hot food for breakfast, it is a bit one-sided. Three types of cheese/sausage can be described as very straightforward.\n\nWhat is also missing, and this is part of the package (at least for us) in a hotel of this class, is free sparkling wine/prosecco with breakfast. But that's complaining at a high level.\n\nSince we couldn't really enjoy the holiday because of the missing luggage - we were then in Bali from April 22nd to May 2nd and the luggage didn't arrive until April 27th - we will do the trip again next year.",

This time we stayed at the new room , the Paiza tower 2 , amazing room with house butler at our service. The room was beautiful , clean and the view was beautiful with city view and the most is outside the lift there’s beautiful sofa for you to sit to wait for the lift , absolutely outstanding. Then we had breakfast at the residence at floor 55 , we had breakfast at 10:30am and because of that time they were actually serving brunch, so breakfast is 6am -10:30am and then 10:30am-1pm is brunch. The food was amazing, buffet style with very high quality food standard , we had lobster, king prawns, long crabs and Wagyu beef, we ate till 1pm , service with the staff was very professional and friendly which make you feel so special and welcome. I will definitely go back and stay there again .",

        "review_title": "Great location, hard products, but the arrival experience was terrible",
        "review_text": "Leaving Malaysia early in the morning, we arrived in Changi airport around 9am, and through the MRT, got to Marina Bay Sands Hotel's check in counter around 11am. Knowing that we were going to arrive early, we sent an email to the hotel a week early to see if there would be any opportunity for an early check-in. In the response, they mentioned the possibility subject to availability.\n\nUpon arriving at the check-in desk at Tower 1, the atmosphere was quite a contrast from the friendly possibility conveyed in the email response. It first took us about 10 minutes of waiting, until someone approached us at the line. Before even looking at our booking, he told us promptly that check-in is not available until 3pm. I mentioned about the email corresspondence, and that is when he reluctantly took my reservation number, then told us to head down to Tower 3 and enquire there, since we would be staying at Tower 3. He also then said there will be a charge for early check-in if it is available.\n\nWhen we got to Tower 3, the check-in counter had 2 people on staff. One was helping a customer while the other stood there and looked at the other person, walking back and forth. Including us, there were 4 more sets of guests waiting in line. It took 30 minutes, I'm not exaggerating here, until that person that was doing nothing, acknowledge the guests in front of us in the line to go talk to him. Then another staff waved us down to go to the check-out counter to help us. The first couple was still standing at the counter, 30 minutes after, talking to the first staff. While we were waiting, the 4 of us in line started talking about how this extreme wait in line seemed to be a tactic from the hotel to discourage anyone to attempt to have an early check-in. To be honest, all I wanted to do at that point was to drop off my luggages for storage so we could be on our way.\n\nAt the Check-out counter, the lady kindly let us know it's because it is around their check out time of 11am, so they are mostly busy with checking the guests out. After some discussions, she advises us that if the room is ready before 3pm for early check-in, they will send us an email. She then proceeds to tell us in great details of\nall the fine-dining restaurants the hotel has to offer, including their multiple signature dishes from each restaurant. I then realized why it took so long for the preivouis guests. We wanted to get out of the hotel to go enjoy our day, so we wanted to leave. She then further informed us that there are renovations going on at Tower 3, and we are on the lower level. While the renovation is on the higher levels, we may still hear noises. I then asked if we could be moved to either Tower 1 or 2 to avoid the noises, she responded that our rate would not allow us to be in the nicer, newly renovated rooms of Tower 1 or 2, but she will do her best to give us the best room in the category in Tower 3. Considering the rate of booking this hotel was just shy of $1,000 SGD, I really didn't like hearing this information. Not only did MBS not inform us through email communication prior to our arrival, but the way the lady informed us the situation made us felt like we were some sort of poor guests that should've spend more to avoid noise inconvenience. We left the hotel a bit miffed, and went about our day. We were given temporary keys so we could access the rooftop pool, one of the main highlights of the hotel. We spent about an hour there before we left. It was nice, had a great view of the city, although a bit hot and smog. After the pool we went about our day.\n\nWe got the email notification that the room was ready at exactly 2:58pm. Once we checked into our room, my previous frustration with the frontline staff pretty much went away. The room was gorgeously appointed. The view to the Garden By The Bay (GBTB) was beautiful. The room itself was quite large, and the bathroom was\nmarbled throughout, nothing sort of a luxury hotel, and easily rivaled the Ritz or JW of the Marriott brands. The entire minibar was free as well. Shortly after our check-in, a gentleman arrived to provide some turndown service. He was quite eager to help, and provided us multiple bags of chips and more coffee and drinks.\nI visited the pool at night for the second time, and this time I felt the magic of this rooftop infinity pool truly came alive. The lighting of the pool was a beautiful hue of turquoise. By now the city is lit up, the temperature dropped a bit, and people are clubbing in one of the rooftop bar with great music. Generally it had a great vibe. The view at night is nothing short of magical, and the pool wasn't very busy either so I never felt crowded. I ended up staying in the pool until it closed at midnight. This was one of the highlights of my Singapore visit.\n\nThe night view of GBTB from our room was even more beautiful than during the day. I took the opportunity and walked around the hotel, and all the way towards GBTB, pass 1am, and took in all its amazing architecture. This hotel is definitely an architectural and engineering masterpiece.\n\nIn the morning, the gentleman from the evening turndown service returned to offer more tea. I asked for his name this time. Chang Cheng was very courteous and we really appreciated his attententiveness during our stay.\n\nAlthough we were offered a discount at their Rise restaurant for breakfast, we decided to go to the casino solely to have a lobster laksa noodle soup from the restaurant within. It was delicious. I also browsed the gift shop situated within the hotel, and bought a book that talked about how the MBS hotel was built.\n\nThroughout our stay, we didn't hear the noise from renovation at all. And upon our check out, the frontline staff graciously offered us a 1-hour late check-out without any hesitation, which we really appreciated. As we called our grab to leave the hotel, the bell service staff checked our Grab details, invited us to wait inside the air-conditioned space, then queued us to head out as our Grab arrived, which we also very much appreciated their care in the service.\n\nOverall I was quite satisfied from this stay, minus the initial impression during the arrival process. I recognize the staff warned us about the renovation noise to temper expectation, but perhaps the delivery could be better, and really don't let your guests wait in line for more than 10 minutes if possible. The hotel's hard\nproduct is world class and top notch, while the soft product could use some improvement.",

Our check-in experience was seamless, and we were thrilled to discover that we had been upgraded to a stunning suite on one of the higher floors, offering breathtaking panoramic views of the city skyline and Marina Bay.\n\nThe suite was nothing short of extraordinary. It featured elegant, modern decor with expansive windows that allowed us to soak in the iconic views at any time of the day. The plush king-sized bed provided the utmost comfort, while the spacious living area and well-appointed bathroom with a deep soaking jacuzzi tub added to the overall opulence of our stay. The attention to detail was evident, from the high-end toiletries to the complimentary Nespresso coffee machine and a well-stocked minibar.\n\nOf course, no visit to Marina Bay Sands would be complete without experiencing the world-renowned Infinity Pool. Floating on the edge of this architectural marvel, with the glittering cityscape stretching out before us, was truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience. The pool area was impeccably maintained, and the poolside service was prompt and courteous.\n\nExploring the integrated resort was a delight, from the high-end shops at The Shoppes to the fascinating ArtScience Museum. The location is perfect for exploring Singapore, with major attractions just a short distance away.\n\nOur stay at Marina Bay Sands was an unforgettable experience, made even more special by the upgrade to a suite and the exceptional service we received throughout. This hotel truly sets the standard for luxury and hospitality, and we can't wait to return for another extraordinary stay.\n\nMarina Bay Sands certainly knows how to elevate the guest experience to extraordinary heights.",

        "review_text": "We also had a stopover at the Marina Bay Sands. Like so many others, we wanted to spend the night here and experience the pool for ourselves. The staff were all very friendly - you can use the pool even before you get the official room key. Which is what we did. You can leave your suitcases at reception. We were lucky here and found a spot by the pool without any problems. However, there is no shade or parasols here, which bothered us a bit and we didn't want to get sunburnt on the first day of our vacation. Due to the construction site in Tower 3, we were upgraded to a suite and moved to Tower 2. We were very happy about the upgrade, although we are sure that the deluxe room would have been very nice too.\nThe hotel and pool are of course great and definitely worth a visit if you have never been there before. Personally, however, I think that staying there once is enough. The room prices are excessive and I would not be willing to spend that much money again. Next time we are in Singapore, we will look for another hotel. But to have been there once in your life was worth it. And I think that is ultimately what the hotel and its pricing policy are aiming for. You don't get to use the pool without staying overnight, and many people want to do that once in their life, which is why they can charge these prices. The hotel itself is friendly, but you have to be aware that you are just one guest among many. The hotel is simply far too big for that.  \nWhat really bothered us was the rooftop bar CÉ LA VI. We wanted to have a drink/cocktail there in the evening. When you go there, the receptionist first checks whether you are even allowed in or whether your clothing is appropriate. Then you go in and just stand there lost. No member of staff looked after us. The music was also far too loud, so you couldn't or didn't want to sit inside. There are very few tables outside, some of them are cordoned off, and you don't really know where you are allowed or should go. We then simply left again - but here too the lady at the entrance was not surprised why we left more or less immediately. We had the feeling that we were not wanted here. The tables here are probably reserved for guests who eat in the restaurant beforehand, which not everyone can or wants to afford. We have seen much better rooftop bars in other 5* hotels in other big cities (e.g. Bangkok).",

Although the view from the room, the interior design of the room and room amenities were fantastic, guest service left much to be desired and the everywhere I went was so packed with people wanting bragging rights. Why was guest service not up to par for a high end luxury hotel?\n1. The gym was located in a different building and I needed to walk through the shopping mall (The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands) among crowd.\n2. I went to the front desk next to the concierge to ask for directions to the gym only to be told by the upstart that he wasn’t the concierge. I scolded him to go ask the concierge who was 10 metres away and on the same counter.\n3. When I asked housekeeping to refill the coffee capsules for my Nespresso, she said it wasn’t her department and i had to dial “express service”.\n4. I had to wait 10 minutes before I got through “express service”, and the person on the other end couldn’t understand English.\n5. The breakfast place was so packed, even the “exclusive” Renku Club ran out of seating, so much so that the wait staff had trouble remembering my fresh juice.\n6. The pool on the 57th floor, despite being for guests only, was crowded with guests taking photos for bragging rights.\n\nIf you are into crowd and don’t mind the below par guest service, but want bragging rights to stay in Singapore’s iconic hotel, then MBS is for you. If you want top-notch service, privacy away from wannabe fashionistas who strut loudly in their LV, Gucci, … then I will suggest better hotels like Shangri-la, Ritz Carlton and Four Seasons.",

        "review_text": "Fantastic 3 night stay. MBS is a stunning flagship for modern Singapore.\nOur suite was exquisite. Huge, spotlessly clean, gorgeous design & great view of the bay, gardens and super trees music and light show. We didn't want to leave!\nParticular thanks to Hill, on reception: she was brilliant. Professional, friendly and helpful and she made our stay extra-special. Thank you.\nWe stayed on 42nd floor, Tower 2, with a separate entrance and lifts to our room. Access to the pool was easy at any time. Our butler(!) reserved a pool cabana - just let them know when you'd like one.\nBreakfast at Spago was relaxed and delicious, and we appreciated the afternoon tea and early evening champagne at Renku.\nWe loved sunrise sound meditation on the rooftop observation deck - an unforgettable experience. If you're there on a Tuesday or Thursday, I highly recommend it. There's no charge for guests but you must book in advance, or can pay to attend if you're staying elsewhere.\nOverall, an an amazing stay.\nThe only things we'd change:\n- 1 breakfast we chose to have at Rise. The choice of food was great, but it was more family-oriented, very noisy and busy.\n- the tech in our suite was glitchy. Couldn't change volume on TV or turn it off. iPads didn't actually control anything, just showed the settings. I'm sure they would have sorted it if we'd asked, but we were enjoying the hotel too much to bother :)",

I was in love with bidet in the bathroom. It was my first time using one and I don't think I can go back. The pool was AMAZING!!! That alone was worth the trip to Singapore.",

        "review_text": "Taking part in the Sound Bath Meditation led by Karu, is an experience you should not miss if you are staying at MBS or wanting to slow down in Sunny Singapore.\n\nIt starts with a beautiful sunrise on the sky deck of the 56th floor at 7:30am. You are greeted by a warm and friendly team in a breathtaking space where the city and the sea surround you, almost as if you are on a mountain top. As the facilitator warms up with his array of instruments, you find comfort on a mat that is provided for you (with water and a towel). A safe space to be held for everyone, Karu invites you to arrive, as yourself and fully present. It is not only a journey through the sounds which not only allow you to tune in to yourself but the pure joy of immersing in the auditory experience. This is not my first sound bath meditation with Karu, and I love how each time there is something for you to take home. The message today: You are responsible for your thoughts and feelings and it is important to accept and understand them first, before taking hold of them . ‘Do not outsource your happiness’.\n\nThis is a great activity to go alone or with your loved ones. No two activity is the same and I encourage you to try it out and see what it may bring you.\n\nThank you.\n🙏🏼 ✨",

        "review_text": "My Uncle & I visited Singapore on a 2-day stop-over, on our way to Siem Reap, Cambodia. My Uncle hasn't been to Singapore in over 30 years, so I decided to stay splurge and stay for 2 nights at the most iconic hotel in Singapore. We arrived at the hotel by taxi from Changi airport at around 11.30am. The doormen helped us to take our luggage from the trunk of our taxi the minute our taxi pulled up at the front entrance of Tower 1. We were then escorted to the check-in counter and there wasn't any queue at all that morning! While we were in the process of checking in, a friendly staff member came around to offer all the arriving guests complimentary bottles of drinking water and Chuppa-chupps lollipops(a popular candy in Asia)! I have traveled around the world, never before has any hotel or resort ever offered their new guests Chuppa-chupps candy!!! As per our booking, we were allocated a twin-bed room on a high floor with a view of the Gardens by the Bay. The check-in process was completed in 7-minutes and our room was ready right away! No need to wait until 3pm like some other previous guests had lamented.\n\nThe room was magnificent, clean, comfortable and spacious, with all the amenities you would expect from a 5-star hotel, plus breathtaking views from the ENORMOUS balcony! This was the first time that we have seen a sofa set(a 3-seater & 2 single seaters) on a hotel room balcony!!! The room also included complimentary mini bar drinks and snacks, which will be replenished once a day during the housekeeping service. We could also request for additional bottles of drinking water, which we did, because we spent a fair bit of time walking around Singapore and the weather here is hot & humid.\n\nThe world-famous infinity edge swimming pool is as spectacular as all the photos on social media has portrayed! We were fortunate that on the day we took a dip in the iconic swimming pool, it wasn't overcrowded and we managed to get some great photos from this facility. Guests will be given 2 pool towels & a bottle of drinking water upon registering to enter the pool. IMPORTANT NOTE: Each guest has to hold 1 individual key card which was issued by the check-in counter upon checking into the hotel, in order to be allowed to enter and use the swimming pool. If you are a couple who are traveling together, both of you have to produce an in-house hotel room key card each, in order to enter the pool. The management has to be very stringent with everyone who wants to enter the swimming pool because in the past, some outsiders have tried various ways to sneak into the iconic swimming pool.\n\nThe famous botanical garden called Gardens By the Bay is connected to this hotel. We took a stroll to the Super Tree Grove to take some photos but we didn't enter the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome.\n\nThere is also a huge shopping mall with plenty of restaurants and a big food court featuring local delicacies, connected to this impressive hotel. The MRT station called Marina Bay is located in the basement of this hotel, enabling all visitors easy access to the very efficient and well-connected public transport network of Singapore.\n\nThe only drawback is: our room rates didn't include any complimentary breakfast despite our room costing USD850 per night! However, we did have dinner at RISE, the buffet restaurant located in the lobby of the ground floor of Tower 1, at our own expense and it was amazing! All-you-can-eat boiled Boston lobsters and Alaskan King Crab legs, plus a huge variety of Asian and Western dishes! The ice creams with local flavours were truly delicious! If you are staying at this hotel, you definitely should try the buffet dinner at RISE. The concierge can help you to make reservations for this restaurant the minute you check-in.\n\nOverall, both of us enjoyed our stay at this hotel even though it is extremely expensive compared to other accommodation options around Singapore. I consider staying here to be a bucket-list, once-in-a-lifetime experience!",

Our biggest complaint was that we got a room with what was supposed to be 2 double beds, but they were literally, slightly wide twins. There was no chance to upgrade as the hotel was apparently full. We were pretty miserable and hot every night. We stayed there for 4 nights. There were definite pluses, but if you don’t sleep, it’s hard to appreciate them. Pluses- excellent staff, amazing pool, stunning views, location. Negatives- tiny beds, food was very expensive, place was huge. But, if you want to go up to see the pool and observation deck, you need to be staying at the hotel, or arrange some kind of card with a dinner reservation I think. It’s one of those things where I’m glad we saw it, but I wish we’d been able to return to the Capitol Kempinski after one night, so that we would have gotten some decent sleep!",

Robby was there to receive us at airport on our return flight and even helped us get our luggage checked in. We spent entire 2 days around hotel as there us a lot to do. Walk from MBS to Gardens By The Way was stunning. Their breakfast at Rise restaurant was certainly better than Spago as there were unlimited options. We would suggest more gluten free and halal options in breakfast, afternoon tea and in room dinning as guests from all over the world stay there. Our stay is memorable for all good reasons.",

        "review_text": "Wow (and a lot of other wows) is how I would describe MBS. From the minute I walked in the door I received amazing service. I was taken in to a special room to complete the checkin process. My room was not ready (to be expected as I was checking it early to make the most of the facilities). Sheila was absolutely lovely and so friendly. The process was seamless and I received a temporary card so I could use the pool. I asked to receive an email when my room was ready (which I did receive in the afternoon). I was also asked if I specially wanted a twin room (which I had booked) and I said that I didn’t mind what room I had.\n\nI headed straight up to the infinity pool and spent the day there. I luckily managed to snag a cabana seat in the adults only area. The pool (the bucket list reason for me wanting to stay at MBS) was amazing. The water was so nice and refreshing. Ordered a couple of cocktails and lunch by the pool. Not cheap, but it was nice to be able to relax.\nOnce I received an email to say that my room was ready I went back to the front desk to collect my room key. I was very excited to hear that I had been upgraded to a newly renovated king suite. It was the nicest hotel room I have ever stayed in. The bed was gigantic. Same with the TV. The bathroom was palatial and so well appointed. They even had Jo Malone shampoo, conditioner, body wash and lotion.\nWhen I made my booking I also said that I was celebrating my birthday and I was blown away when I had a knock at the door, with the hotel delivering me a birthday cake.\nAfter dinner in the MBS Mall, I returned to the pool. It was amazing to see Singapore lit up and night. Make sure you spend time in both the pool and the spa, as you can see Gardens by the Bay lit up from the spa.\nI had heard mixed reviews about MBS, but I am so happy that I stayed here as I received the most amazing service from start to finish, and whilst it was not cheap, it was truly a memorable stay and bucket list experience for me!",

We stayed for three nights and had two rooms with balcony overlooking the gardens by the bay - I think a pretty good side as you spend a great deal of time in the pool looking at the city anyway! Our rooms in Tower 3 had not yet been refurbished but to ne honest most hotels would consider them excellent and they were very clean, tidy and did not look aged. The new rooms I think would be even better! The service was exceptional in all areas - I called about our A/C for one room as temp was too cold and could not seem to adjust it - a technician was with us within 5 minutes! The pool area is as great as you would hope and dont worry about loungers etc - there are plenty and they manage access very closely keeping to residents only - the busiest time was Saturday night but even then no real issue with finding space. Breakfast fine (slight queue) and the check in experience was faultless. We asked for an early check in to the rooms and got 12pm. All in all I can't fault it and what an amazing iconic building and location - do stay you wont regret it!",

A very modern hotels with lots of amenities, very close to Gardens by the Bay, shopping mall, food court. But it was extremely busy and crowded, I think it was a bit too crowded for us. It lacks the personal touch due to the size.\n\nWe wanted to see what the hype was about with the roof top infinity pool, the good news is that they are open from 6am to midnight. We went around 10pm to avoid too many people. The view was breathtaking but there were still a lot of people in the in the pool at 10pm, taking selfie and videos. There isn't much space to swim. Basically, it's a plunge pool for photo op. You also have a beautiful view of Gardens by the Bay from the room.\n\nIt's a lovely 5* hotel and we did have a lovely stayed, I think it one of those tick the box hotel just to see the hype.

        "review_text": "Photographs well. Experience is something different. Let’s start with the obvious. This is a massive hotel with a cool rooftop. For a few nights in heart of everything tourists come to see, this is the place. We also must note, we stayed during Chinese lunar new year. Crowds were well above normal we were told. However, we came back a few weeks later. While the crowd was less horrendous, it was still very crowded\n\nIt’s very pricey and for what you get, which is a high volume theme park like queues everywhere you go. We felt more like cattle moving through a space. The mass of hotel guests and visitors means, a hotel guest has few to no options for restaurants as they are all always fully booked out. As others have mentioned, sizable minimums apply (the restaurant which did have availability had a $300 minimum per person, and a table was not guaranteed). At this restaurant, the hostess tugged at my sleeve to inform me of minimum, dress code, and other rules.\n\nIn other restaurants, they also charge for everything. Tap water - there’s a charge. A wet nap which they provided, there was a charge.\n\nThe staff is friendly enough, but not much in the way of service, more like moving people through. We sat at a restaurant for about fifteen minutes waiting for a server to take our order. A manager came by, pointed and tapped at her watch and said we needed to order as they were about to take the last order of the evening. We explained then she might want to have her server come by, or take the order herself.\n\nThe good, The bad and the ugly.\n\nWhat we do like about this hotel is its location and views which can’t be beat. The photo op ready pool deck. Beware, like many similar travel photos, the pictures outshine the actual subject, but the day we spent poolside was worth it. We also had an incredible welcome by the transportation department at Changi the airport. The driver was great, and our check in experience was in room and very personal. The ability to connect with Guest Services at anytime through what’s app texting was great. A feature we like.\n\nThe rooms are dated, dirty carpets and paint coming off the walls like old Vegas style at least the room in the tower we got.\n\nHousekeeping was excellent.\n\nThe Spago restaurant for breakfast, lunch, drinks and pool service. Was great. Excellent staff and management.\n\nYou are also deceptively close to the Gardens by the Bay, Marina Bay, and shopping. Unfortunately, due to how the hotel is designed, and security continually blocking entrances and exits (no reasons given) you often need to leave the hotel, circumnavigate the building (remember it’s huge), then find your way to the MRT tunnel to get to Gardens of the Bay. We once ended up in the shopping mall across the street, and could not find an entrance which let us back into the hotel. Literally one sign pointed in one direction to the hotel, only to walk about 50 meters to see another sign pointing us back in the direction we just came.\n\nFor us, this was a one and done. Maybe a person preference - too big, too crowded, too difficult. Who wants that on vacation.",

The bed is luxuriously comfortable and huge. The television is ginormous. The bathroom has a shower that is big enough for a small family, a Japanese toilet, a full size bath and dual sinks with all the bathroom amenities you could think about needing. The dressing room has more storage than I have ever seen in a hotel room before. The lounge area can be converted into a sofa bed but note this is not particularly big. It was just about big enough for skinny 6 and 8 year olds, two older occupants would have required lots of snuggling. Plenty of water, chocolates and tea and coffee provided. We had two balconies overlooing the gardens and could watch the SuperTree Rhapsody from here. It wasn't wide enough for balcony furniture but I think this will depend on what level you get, lower down the balconies are wider but higher up there is a better view. City view there are no balconies. The room attendant did a thorough job each day and even coiled up or the wires for your electronics for you!\n\nClearly people stay here to use the pool, and it is stunning. There were plenty of loungers when we were there. It is surprisingly not that warm a pool, particularly when it has been overcast. Drinks by the pool come with the expected pricetag (one alcoholic and one non-alcoholic cocktail was almost 50 SGD (£29). Pool is only accessible to hotel guests; no cabana rental and I'd be surprised if people can \"break in\". There are staff at the entrance scanning keys and every person has to have a key, even children. So you can't book a room for 2 and 6 people enter the pool. Of course, this exclusivity means it is not too busy for guests. We watched the Spectra show from the pool, which I'd recommend. Pool was open 6am until midnight. Plenty of towels available. We had robes in our room which we wore to the pool.\n\nBreakfasts is plentiful and delicious. So many options to chose from - western, Asian, Japanese.\n\nObviously the location is prime. We walked to gardens by the bay. Merlion park is around 20-30 mimutes walk taking in the helix bridge and the hawker market at Te La Pau is a similar distance. The airport was around 20 minutes in a taxi (which cost about 26-30 SGD) and the zoo is around 35 minutes drive. There is an MRT under the shopping centre but we did not use it.\n\nWe were well looked after by the premium team. Every member of staff we engaged with in the hotel (including club lounge, rise restaurant, pool, sands lifestyle team, front door team) was courteous and charming. In particular the staff at the tower 1 doors who would spontaneously offer tips on Singapore (I think one was called Mr Lo - he proudly was telling me of his son who is a medical student but also gave us several other tips), our wonderful happy limo driver and Arabella who assisted us as the airport. All the staff are an asset to this hotel and if you chose to engage with them, they will ensure you have a wonderful experience in Singapore.\n\nWe really hope to be able to come back, but for now, my children are so happy that they got to swim in the \"Mariokart pool\" - anyone who has raced Singapore Speedway on Mariokart will understand.",

        "review_text": "My wife and I stayed at Marina Bay Sands for a part of our honeymoon and loved it. We cannot recommend this hotel enough. Prior to booking, we looked at a variety of hotels in Singapore and thought we would go with the hype of Marina Bay and it was definitely the best decision.\n\nWhere do I start? When we arrived at the hotel, the staff were so attentive. We were told at check-in that we were given a free upgrade to the Butler Suite. It was unbelievable! It wasn't just the room (which was incredible), we received all of the benefits alongside it. For example, afternoon tea with drinks (alcoholic if wanted) and food from 2:30-4:30, then more free food and drink 4:30-6:30pm with the late afternoon canapes. The food consisted of huge prawns, crab, lamb etc. As well as this, we had our reserved cabana every day which came with unlimited soft drinks and one alcoholic drink. This is just a couple of things that the Butler Suite came with and honestly, this gesture from the hotel just made a lovely ending to our honeymoon trip.\n\nWe stayed 4 nights in this luxury and didn't want to leave.\n\nWe live in Dubai and have experienced a number of amazing hotels but what we received at Marina Bay was on another level.\n\nThe breakfast had everything you could think of and catered for a variety of cultures. The 1 minute walk to the Marina Bay gardens which was beautiful was great. The tall iconic infinity pool was stunning and has an adult only section too as the huge pool is split into three sections. The staff from arrival to when we left were phenomenal.\n\nOur butlers - Danial and Vince. I have to say, we were so lucky to have these two look after us on our whole stay at Marina Bay. They made our stay that bit more special that it already was. They both would pick us up from the gym and guide us to our tables and one thing which I will remember is that we asked Danial to recommend some restaurants to visit for dinner in the morning. By lunchtime, Danial had printed out a booklet (that he made by himself) with his top restaurant suggestions. It stated how many if there were few seats left as well as other specific details which I thought was just a lovely touch. Honestly, both Danial and Vince's service was impeccable and Marina Bay are very lucky to have two hardworking and attentive employees such as yourselves.\n\nThere is so many other elements that were great about Marina Bay. A hotel and package I would and will recommend to others.\n\nWhat a hotel!",

This was all in a self contained part of the suite.\n\nThe roof-top infinity pool naturally is the draw card i'd say for nearly everyone. Early morning or late evening swims allowed for lesser crowds and great photo opps with generous open / close times. It spands across nearly the entire roof-top which allows for quiet parts to find and enjoy the moment / view / swim.\n\nYou have an abundance of choise for food, drinks, breakfast locations (both on the roof-top pool and ground level) at Spargo or Rice along with multiple bars and resturants throughout.\nLAVO which is an Italian themed restaurant on the roof-top also is worth dining at.\nThe underneath walk-thru connecting you to 'The Shoppes' complex entirely is a nice way to wander through the warmer parts of the day and so easy to move around.\n\nAs mentioned at the start, it is a Bucket-list Luxury Hotel\nwhich is on such an extreme scale (size wise) that you can feel quite overwhelmed in trying to take it all in and see everything it has to offer.\n\nThe service provided though by Apriel and the team are what made this Hotel such an enjoyable experience and one we won't forget. Thank you also to the initial bookings team and cleaning staff for our rooms who did a terrific job on every day of our stay.",

The room was, as I say, stunning - Faultless in fact aside from the slightly too wintery bedding for the climate.\n\nBreakfast downstairs (can’t recall the name) was included and was faultless - Upstairs at Spago was a little more lacklustre but still fine.\n\nThe reason I call this an experience is all the people who simply visit the MBS to visit it - From the lobby which is like a shopping centre to the rooftop pool which is a bit of a joke with others paying to enter. I get the economics of it, but as a guest of the hotel, it doesn’t actually feel like you’re an exclusive guest.\n\nThe service was actually fairly poor - Nothing to write home about and unlike other establishments in the city. Felt like another number rather than a valuable customer.",

        "review_text": "Maybe we were spoiled from our prior stays at Amansara and Capella right before checking into MBS. but the hotel left a lot to be desired.\n\nWe stayed 3 nights at the Paiza Signature Suite. Originally we had booked the Paiza Premiere Suite, but due to the number of people, we wanted to have at least an additional powder room. So we decided to inquire about an upgrade upon arrival. And things started going south from right then (see CONS section below).\n\nBut before I begin with the longer list of things that could have been better, I would just like to mention the highlights of our stay.\n\n>>PROS\n\n1. Ivan Teng, our limo driver was AMAZING!!! He alone deserves 10 stars and is the reason I gave 3 stars. We requested a limo for 4 hours on our second day to tour the city and were lucky enough to be assigned to Ivan. We basically gave the hotel a list of places we wanted to visit, and requested we stop whenever we wanted to get off the limo and walk around. Ivan was not only accommodating, but when we got hungry, he gave us lunch spot recommendations (one of the best meals we had in Singapore!), basically gave us a tour by explaining the buildings, neighborhoods, etc., was super funny and easy to talk to, and when we went to get some fruits at a local market, and had forgotten to get Singapore Dollars (we only had US dollars), he came to the rescue. I cannot say enough praises about Ivan. Although our stay was far from amazing, Ivan alone is enough to make me consider a return to MBS (but then I was told we are not able to request specific limo drivers).\n\n2. Jeffrey Lim, another limo driver. The best department at MBS must be their limo drivers, because most of them were amazing. But Jeffrey Lim, whom we had only a brief 15 minute ride with, was so friendly and courteous. He was like a breath of fresh air. For some reason, about 90% of the staff at MBS did not introduce themselves by name (which most staff members at high end resorts/hotels do). Jeffrey not only introduced himself the moment we got in the car, but was very accommodating.\n\n3. Win, housekeeping team. Now most of everything at MBS was incredibly slow (will mention below). But Win was anything but. He showed up the moment we requested anything, and understood our needs right away. So, thank you.\n\n4. Serena, one of the butlers. We met Serena on the second day of our stay. Our stay in general was quite disappointing as the title mentions, and as will be explained below. However, Serena tried her best to amend things, which I really appreciated. Also, after our check out, we discovered one of our companion's wallet was missing, and we had to go back to the hotel. Serena was more than accommodating in getting a search going at the hotel. We did find it somewhere else later, but Serena and the staff's help was much appreciated.\n\n5. Soo, one of the managers at Paiza Sky Residence. Paiza Sky Residence had opened the day prior to our departure, and they had only just officially opened, so it is more than understandable that things are being worked out, one of those things was missing a decaf option for coffee. Upon merely suggesting that it may be a good option to have for the future, Soo made it happen right away.\n\n6. Xander, one of the butlers gave us a really authentic recommendation for a local fruit stand.\n\n7. As everyone knows, the hotel has inside it, or is connected to many attractions--Gardens by the Bay, Shoppes, Casino, etc--you basically won't even have to leave the complex to make it a vacation.\n\n8. We actually had some very smelly food during one of the stays. We ate it on the balcony, and requested plastic wraps when disposing of it, and since we already had air purifiers in the room (see below), we made good use of them. But we really appreciated the staff for accommodating this.\n\nAnd the pros pretty much end there.\n\n>>CONS\n1. The Check-in process took 90+ minutes. We did request an upgrade, and the hotel had to check the availability. So taking slightly more than usual is definitely understandable. But I mean, OVER 90 minutes...? Upon requesting an upgrade to a room with a bathroom and a powder room, and explaining that we needed two toilets, the staff member who helped us check in just did not understand my request and kept asking me if I needed two bathrooms. I had to explain the request to the staff member about 4 times.\n\nIt took about an hour JUST to figure out if there was a room available and to give us a quote on the new price. And upon agreeing to the price, took another 30 minutes of us standing at the check-in desk to secure the room.\n\n2. We were not told about the Paiza Check-in desk. Although we had from the initial reservation, booked a Paiza Suite, we were not told about the Paize Check-in section. Our 90+ minutes would have been very much easier to bear if we had known.\n\n3. While the room was getting ready, we were shown to Renku, the lounge. We ordered Coke, Peppermint Tea, and water. You can imagine how tired and thirsty we might have been after the long stressful check-in process. One of my companions had actually flown in that morning and was just dying to relax. Imagine my frustration when the peppermint tea and even the WATER took 25 minutes to arrive.\n\nAfter more waiting... for our butler, we just could not stand it anymore and requested we just walk to the room ourselves.\n\nNow the Paiza Signature room comes at OVER 6000 SGD a night. Yes, you read that right. three 0's. So imagine my surprise when...\n\n4. ...we got into the room, we found no welcome fruit or cookies/snacks other than the regular complimentary food. We only received them when we called to ask about it (\"hey... so do you guys usually do any welcome fruits?\").\n\nAnd you know how high end hotels usually restock the welcome fruit daily? MBS did not. One day they didn't, the other day they did... inconsistent.\n\n5. ...there was hair in the corner of the bathroom. Despite them telling us that do deep cleaning after every guest. I was just so tired of everything at this point, I didn't really bother to do much about it. But again, at this price point... and having mentioned a deep cleaning after every guest?\n\n6. ...the room smelled of chemical--probably from the deep cleaning. However, at the price point, I would expect them to have figured the smell out. We had to basically run an air purifier and an ionizer during the entire stay.\n\n7. ...there was a strong smell of cigarettes in the hallway. We had requested a non-smoking room. But I guess they do not group the room types together. Walking out of the room was unpleasant every single time. At least the smell didn't seep into the room.\n\n8. ...one of the 2 iPads used to control the room did not work. I did let them know and they offered to fix it. But the timing was off and the engineer came when we were in the room so we just told them we'd use the other iPad. I'm starting to sound like a broken record, but at the price point... I would expect things to be working at tip top shape from the get-go.\n\n9. ...the light along the curtain, when turned off, makes a ticking noise. This kept me up for hours until the light cooled down and stopped making the noise. I figured there was nothing the staff could do about this, so I did not mention this part.\n\n10. ...we had to use no less than 2 bath towels to stop the flood from the shower every time we used it. So I read in an article, that the hotel purposefully left a gap on the bottom of the door to the shower so that the mat wouldn't get caught. Now don't get me wrong, the shower is one of the most gorgeous and beautiful parts of the room. However, I feel like if they were smart, they would have added a threshold the height of a mat rather than just leaving a gap where the water would just flood out. It didn't help that everything was marble and VERY slippery when wet (beautiful to look at, but dangerous nonetheless). Also didn't mention this to the staff because again, it's part of the design of the room.\n\n11. During our stay, we requested that we get a seat at Lavo, their rooftop bar. We specifically requested the al fresco high table right next to the kid's pool. We also mentioned that the reservation would be UNNECESSARY if those specific seats were not available. We were told the butler team was able to secure a reservation at 10pm of the requested day. We actually worked the night's schedule around this reservation. So imagine, again, my disappointment, when we were shown to an indoor table. This was one of a number of miscommunications within the staff it seemed.\n\n12. We ordered the fruit platter the same night as 11 above, and requested that we get as much tropical fruits as possible if available. We waited over 60 minutes, but had not gotten the fruits. When inquired, they just told us that there was some kind of a miscommunication. The butler team did give us an extra plate of fruit as a token of apology.\n\n13. Check out process wasn't the smoothest. So we did mention most of our concerns to one of the managers at the hotel. And the butler team gave us some gifts (candle, musical toy, faux leather tray) and the management was gracious enough to promise us a discount of about 16% (which we had in writing via text). However, upon checkout, when we got the bill, the marked discount was 12%. When inquired, we were told this was the first time the staff member had heard about it. The staff member had to go back, check with her team, and came back with the new bill. Although the discount was MUCH appreciated, it was unfortunate that even the check out process wasn't as smooth as it could have been.\n\nAnd below are not necessarily cons, but just small things the hotel could maybe work on to become a high(er) end hotel:\n\n1. It would be great if the staff all introduced themselves and also remembered our names correctly. I was referred to by the wrong name about 3 to 4 different times by the butler team.\n\n2. While dining at Paiza Sky Residence, which had opened the previous day, one of the servers actually took one of my companion's napkin away in the middle of the meal. I feel like the staff member was trying to freshen up the napkin when we actually put in an additional order, and the staff member walked away to put in the order. But I've actually never seen this happen anywhere else so it was a bit humorous.\n\n3. As mentioned above we were not told of the Paiza Check In counter. Ever. Not only when checking in, but even during our stay. I just feel like this is something that guests need to be at least informed of when any one of the staff at the hotel realizes a guest is staying at one of the Paiza rooms. There were a few other services and details that could have used mentioning/explaining.\n\nAll in all, unfortunately, MBS was sorely disappointing...especially for what we paid. Mostly service and communication, and I'd say even the quality of the breakfast spread left quite a lot to be desired. It would be nice to not need a discount or multiple apologies, and rather have had been delivered the expected experience.",

        "review_text": "Marina Bay Sands has been one of my dream destinations since 2013, and while our stay was quite luxurious, there were a couple of things which prevent me from rating this place the full 5 stars.\n\nI'll start by listing everything great about the hotel.\n\nI booked a room with a gardens by the bay view. The room itself was a considerable size and the view was incredible as we were on the 27th floor. The bed was large, the room had a charming design (despite us not being in one of the newly renovated ones), the bathroom was well stocked with Roberto Cavalli toiletries, and the minibar was restocked every day with a good selection of soft drinks.\n\nWe were also there to celebrate an anniversary and the staff kindly provided us with a small complimentary chocolate cake which tasted incredible. Most of the staff throughout the hotel were also very accommodating and were extremely kind to us.\n\nWe opted for the breakfast in our stay and went to the ground floor restaurant every morning. The quality and selection of the food was to a high standard and was some of the best hotel food I've ever eaten.\n\nThe rooftop pool was the main reason I booked this hotel and the views were definitely what I had hoped for. They even provide a suncream dispenser free of charge to all guests which was a much needed amenity.\n\nWhile we were waiting for our room to be ready, and after we checked out, we were provided with a temporary access card which allowed us to use the hotel's facilities such as the pool, which was a nice gesture.\n\nNow onto some minor things which I felt reflected badly on this hotel.\n\nWe had just landed in Singapore and wanted to get to our room to rest, however were met with a huge line for check-in, this took away from the luxury feel of a 5 star hotel, but luckily the line moved quickly. The room wasn't ready and the staff told us that they will send us a text when it is, however I advised them that we have new Singaporean SIM cards for our stay, and that they should update the system with it because they had our home numbers saved. They told us that it will be dealt with, however the sms went to our old number, and we had to go to the check in line again a few hours later to see whether our room was ready or not.\n\nWe finally got to the room, and one of the staff members entered our room without knocking, this was odd but they did apologise to us and since we had just entered, it wasn't a big deal.\n\nBreakfast queues were also an issue, the staff told us to get there before 8am to \"beat the rush\" which was already a red flag, but we didn't realise how bad it was until we actually went down. The lines in the mornings were extremely long, and did not reflect the amount of money we were paying. Some days we were waiting for up to 30 minutes to be seated. We even tried to go to the top floor restaurant one day as we were told it would be quieter, but the line was even worse than the one downstairs so we avoided it entirely.\n\nAnother thing which took away from the opulent feel of the hotel was the pool itself, while the view was amazing, it was incredibly crowded. Some days we had to walk around for a while to even find a seat so that we could sunbathe or put our stuff down. It would only start to quieten down towards the latter part of the evening.\n\nLastly, we decided one night to go for a drink at the rooftop bar called Ce La Vie. There was a receptionist who'm we asked directions from, but she was too engrossed on her phone to even notice that we were standing in front of her, she finally looked up and asked \"what\" not even realising that we were asking her a question. This isn't the kind of service you'd expect at a hotel like this.\n\nTo summarise, it is a good hotel with fancy rooms, nowhere else in the world will you find its picturesque views. Although, I find myself wondering whether I would return due to the aforementioned issues. It seems the hotel justifies its price primarily based on the pool view, however in order to be in line with what they advertise themselves to be, there are some improvements that in my opinion should be made to achieve the reputation that the hotel aims to hold.",

        "review_text": "Well, well, well, where do I start. From the moment you arrive you’re hurdled into a cattle queue that feels like you’re off to be slaughtered. The desks and queuing system resemble that of a primark store, thankfully our front of house was rather kind and actually gave us a newly renovated room hence the 3 stars. You’re not escorted to your room or the lifts which make it difficult because the signage is impossible, the place is built like a maze. Now for the truly exceptional treat to your luxury stay, the rooftop infinity pool! Oh sorry, I meant the butlins water park. The pool is packed full of screaming kids, you might as well be in a water park. Ironically the kids pool didn’t have a single child in. We tried to go for breakfast on the rooftop restaurant, yet again faced with a queue, then upon being shown to our table we were sat on what could only be described as a school lunch table with a backless chair, all for the price of 100 SGD (for 2), we actually left at this point and decided to dine in a local spot nearby for half the price. In the afternoon we sampled the infinity pool and the views are spectacular I have to say but ruined by the flurry of influencers attempting to con their following into thinking they’re living a lavish lifestyle when in actual fact they’re bathing in children’s urine. At this point I decided to order a lemon ice tea which I got the cheque book out for at a whopping 8 dollars. Wow, it came as a punchy lemon juice. I asked the pool side service to replace it and they asked me how I’d like it made, funny enough I actually had an iced lemon tea for 4 dollars in the breakfast place and it was made to perfect without me even asking them! I thought this was supposed to be a 5 star resort?? Lastly, we were advised that upon our checkout after our 2 night stay that we would be allocated a room to have a shower and clean up before our flight as our flight wasn’t until 11pm, and yes you better believe it, there wasn’t any rooms available. There also isn’t any allocated space to change, sit or freshen up. The whole place is actually cleverly designed to feed tourists in, give them a somehow expensive but fictitious experience and huddle you out ready for the next set of unlucky, unaware victims. Stay for 1 night only, enjoy the views and leave to stay at a more customer service central hotel.",

Magnificent architecture, GREAT location - you can walk to Gardens by the Bay, a must-see attraction in Singapore - amazing amenities (infinity pool on the 57th floor), first class service and excelente restaurants. You can also ride the escalators down to the basement and find a LARGE number of hawker style food stalls. Relatively expensive but staying there is a unique experience! There was some remodel going on at the time (noise during the day in T3) and as a tourist attraction the lobby is always crowded. One of the breakfast rooms is in 57th floor, right by the roof top pool and breakfast is buffet and/or a la carte. Special mention to Mei Yi that took care of us every single day at breakfast.

        "review_text": "Very nice hotel. Gigantic with its 3 towers and astonishing with its architecture. During our stay in Singapore we spent the first 3 nights there. On our arrival we were very well received in a small lounge for check-in. The Marina Bay garden view room was spacious and comfortable. Very high prices all the same for what is offered. Avoid breakfast in the two restaurants that offer it. We tested on the roof at the Spago restaurant. Very expensive at 75 EUR per person and unremarkable. Are not capable of cooking two fried eggs correctly and the orange juice not even squeezed on site as well as the pastries are unworthy of such an establishment. For breakfast, it's better to go to the ground floor to eat an almond croissant with a coffee at Origin + Bloom at the foot of tower 3. Avoid meals in the hotel's restaurants. Are very expensive. We tried dinner at the Rise restaurant on the ground floor. For more than 100 EUR per person any buffet. Only the champagne was very good at $110, as well as the macaroons from the dessert buffet. At the shellfish buffet everything is cold and the shrimp had no taste. Very pleasant rooftop swimming pool offering a magnificent view of the city and its skyscrapers. Open until midnight. Sipping a cocktail after taking a dip while admiring the magnificent view is an undeniable pleasure. At the foot of the hotel there is a magnificent shopping center but there are only luxury boutiques and local restaurants in the basement at a more affordable end (tower 3 side). Last point if you book a room in this hotel ask for a room in a tower where there is no work! Otherwise impossible to take a nap due to the noise of the jackhammer.",

Daily light shows from the Garden and water show next to the ArtScience museum. Last but not least, the Infinity pool that’s available to guests only. What a view.

It was conducted by Karuna who was kind enough to share his own story as well. Simply brilliant and a powerful session to reset myself.",

The infinity pool is more like a public swimming pool and totally overcrowded.

But that itself is probably part of the concept and why Marina Bay Sands is famous all over the world. Our room was one of the newer rooms and everything was clean and tidy. Room service also worked without any problems. We also had a great view at the light show in the Marina Bay at night. Definitely a must stay when you are in Singapore.",

        "review_text": "Post on behalf of husband butnI was one of the occupants.\n\nSubject: EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING EXPERIENCE\n\nAlthough I know MBS will still fully book no matter how bad their services are, no matter how many complaints they receive, but I still wanna share the bad experiences during my stay on the 8 mar.\n\n1st Booked 7 rooms, sent email to request check in together for all rooms, reservation team replied ok, but during check in, front desk was unfriendly and said cannot check in together because I was not there and my wife checked in for me. My wife requested high floor and only given 7th floor, and she requested to check in together so that my guests will not get low floor, but front desk person said will try their best, so wife requested the lady to prepare all keys and I only need to retrieve when I reached with guests. The front desk lady said ok but when I reached with guests, front desk took 1 HOUR to give me key cards!!! Really really bad!! All the promises were all lies!! My guests are extremely disappointed all due to MBS EMPTY PROMISE AND inflexibility and rigid staff. Despite me paying so much but not getting the right treatment is just basically horrible.\n\n2nd, we got 7th floor room and there was strong sewage smell, wife told the housekeeping but She gave only diffuser and explained cannot do much because smell from drain. The housekeeping lady was nice but she couldn't do much and Wife needed to go off and front desk packed so couldnt request for room change. Ended up we believed the sewage smell or diffuseR cause my son's nose to be sensitive and did not feel well after spending the night there. Really really bad!!! Spent 10k yet stayed in sewage smell room, emailed MBS ask for compensation and yet MBS person said no compensation. Of course la, they wont bother small business from me, they no need do any nice thing hotel also full, so why would they bother about my complaint right! They called me to say sorry but useless la... The sewage smell was obviously full of bacteria.\n\n3rd, the worst part ---we went for breakfast at Spago and my wife almost ingested a part of chipped handglove is really atrocious and disgusting. I seriously thinking of cirluating the photo around but my wife's stopping me from doing so. I was not there with wife, because I was busy, if I were there, should really post the disgusting glove in porridge. They took the glove rather quickly though. So they waived off the breakfast but I think that was only fair because we didnt even eat anything after that disgusting glove! I WANT TO HIGLIGHT THIS, how can a hotel claiming to be a 5 star hotel making such unacceptable nonsense mistake? Totally atrocious. I paid a lot of money for the smelly room with unhygienic retaurant.\n\nSent few emails but no reply until say will.pst FB, so called to say sorry, which really useless. Compensation should be given but like i said, their business good so they cant be bothered.\n\nI am extremely angry, disappointed and unhappy with my stay at MBS, share with you all la to make this known or I feel sibei imbalance. 10K le!! Yet worth less than 1k for sure!",

        "review_text": "We splurged to stay here for the final night of our Singapore stopover. We were lucky to get upgraded to a newly renovated room overlooking the park, and it was pure luxury. So this review comes with the caveat that we did not pay full price for the room we got. If we'd stayed in the lower room type we actually booked (which was still incredibly expensive), our review would only be 4 stars because it wouldn't have been as special.\n\nMoving on... The lobby was busy but there were helpful staff to direct us, and check-in was relatively easy. We tried using the app but it wouldn't sync our booking to our room (possibly because of the upgrade?).\n\nThe rooftop pool is as amazing as everyone says. Unfortunately we had bad weather and didn't get to fully enjoy it, but can't blame the hotel for that.\n\nIf you get a room overlooking the park, you can enjoy the Supertree light show from the comfort of your room! Great for us since it was raining during the show, so we didn't have to risk getting soaked.\n\nThey kindly gave us access to a shower room after check-out so we could freshen up before our evening flight home. It was basically a small hotel room (no bed) with the bathroom stocked with amenities, plus water bottles and snacks. Amazing!\n\nIt's important to note that all the shops and restaurants in the adjoining mall have significantly inflated prices. Even Starbucks and Din Tai Fung (dumpling restaurant) were way more expensive than at other Singapore locations. On that note, we highly recommend Origin + Bloom cafe in the lobby for a coffee and pastry.\n\nWould we stay here again? We wouldn't come back until all rooms have been renovated, to ensure it's the special experience you'd expect for the price you pay.",

We were able to sit back, relax, and watch the Gardens by the Bay Light show.",

        "review_text": "We will certainly never stay here again. First impressions stick and MBS made a lasting impact with our arrival. 5 rows deep of taxi chaos out the front of tower 1 was a prelude. Our luggage was whisked away (more about this later) and we entered without a greeting. Looking up in the lobby is a marvel but at ground level totally inhuman. Packed, nowhere to sit and oddly walled off from the long spectacular space with high wall of a food outlet.\n\nShockingly our next experience was a three row deep snaking queue to check in. Our wait was 50mins, standing. Trying to download and use their app to check in was fruitless as, on our phones, registration for an account didn’t work. Finally we got to our room (tower 3 a decent walk away) eager to head to the Gardens by the Bay nearby but another wait began for our luggage. We called about its whereabouts twice during our wait of 45mins and no one could tell us where is was or when we could expect it.\n\nDinner: I mistakenly assumed that staying here we would be able to get a table for a meal. Every table was booked so no such luck. Fortunately as the crowded but incredible rooftop pool was a reason we wanted to stay, we could get a basic meal in our swimmers.\nBetter communication before arriving could have helped on this point.\n\nOur experience of the MBS was epically impersonal, way finding was non existent (prepare to get lost and confused!) and an antiquated lack of sustainability practices topped off the experience.",

        "review_text": "We started our vacation in Singapore by staying here for 5 nights, and enjoyed every minute of it. Yes, it is a large resort and very busy, but that is part of the glamour and excitement. Our room was in Tower 3 on the 33rd floor overlooking the gardens. We found the room to be very clean, spacious with modern amenities. A ginormous flat screen TV. The resort provided bottled water plus complimentary beverages in the small refrigerator. Nice robes and slippers for our comfort and use during our stay. Also gave us a big platter of fresh fruits upon arrival and mid stay.\n\nThe view overlooking the garden was a bonus, as we enjoyed the light shows in the evening right from our room. Facing the gardens also gave us sweeping view to the sea. Part of our reasons for staying here is to use the stunning rooftop infinity pools on the 57th floor. Nothing short of perfection. The pool staff is elite, the food and beverages were superb, and we used the pool during the day as well as at sunset to maximize the amazing views. To see the bright moon light up the sky filled with beautiful city lights was so special.\n\nThe location of the resort is also great. Just a walkway to the Gardens By the Bay, as well as to endless restaurants and shops. Even a food court/center, filled with many great eats (in AC!). The MRT is also located nearby. We also used the gym a few times, although with quite a walk from our room. We walked the pedestrian Helix bridge to reach the Singapore Flyer, as well did the short way over to Lau Pa Sat hawker food center. We felt the city is very walkable, even went to the Merilion statue via the route around the waterfront.\n\nAs for the resort staff, it is clear that they have extensive service training. Special thanks to the front desk staff for smooth check-in and check-out process. We especially enjoyed talking to Din and Adele at the Concierge desk, they were delightful and so helpful with our questions.\n\nWith the highest rating of 5 stars, we really wanted to give the Marina Bay Sands 10! Bravo!",

        "review_text": "I was in Singapore and knew I had to stay here, I booked a room for us on a Sunday night and was so happy I made the effort to do so, I was in 2 minds whether to book, its an American Vegas style hotel in Asia but it was so worth it you get the fantastic service and hospitality of Singapore but the fun aspect of an American Vegas style hotel. Our check in was seamless Patrick was lovely Peach very helpful and May upgraded us, so we were super happy. Our room was on the 39 floor overlooking the gardens, so nice for the show in the evening (although I would recommend actually being in the gardens for it to get a better experience,if your not there for the show do have a walk around its lovely, the animal sculptures of endangered species is very moving) You walk into your room and the curtains open, a nice touch with a great view. The decor was lovely with some very nice design touches, beds were amazing, bathroom super luxe and toiletries were Jo Malone also being upgraded you get a much nicer robe which becomes obvious when you are at the pool! The pool... so worth it! there is an adults section which is great however being a Sunday there wasn't too many children about, the beds get busy but there is a constant turn around 1 thing we didn't realise there is sun screen provided near the area you do the pool check in. As only hotel guests can use the roof top infinity pool it makes you feel special! the pool is 1 of the reasons to stay at the hotel and it really was a fantastic view and yes I got lots of pictures of me at the edge like in the advert for the hotel! We ate at the pool so food was from Spago a Californian restaurant with a very nice menu, while I was staying elsewhere I came to MBS and ate at CUT by Wolfgang Puck which I highly recommend the chicken is enormous it arrived as a full bird 1.1 kg they took it away and carved it for me. While staying at MBS we ate at the new French restaurant DB Bistro which we didn't enjoy so much maybe it was not to our taste? We visited the casino, free to tourists but $150 for locals! you must have your passport and Singapore landing card to enter. No quite as much fun as a Vegas casino the games are a little different and the gambling seemed more intense, but we had to give it a go and it was a nice finish to our evening. I read a lot about this hotel and on my visit to eat there before my stay there I was a little shocked how busy it was and felt it was almost a little too touristy, but that aside the architecture is totally amazing, the staff superb, if you love to shop the mall is great every shop you could possible wish for if you like high end, the evening light and water shows are a nice touch and I must say my whole experience was 10/10 we loved it, would I return now that I have done the pool and casino YES I would.",

The mall attached is breathtaking and the hotel offers so many restaurants you can’t go wrong with any of them. Lavo was amazing for a rooftop experience (highly recommend the meatball!) , Wakudu had the freshest fish if you’re looking for high end Japanese cuisine, and you can’t go wrong with room service.\n\nEvery part of the hotel is a work of art. Almost every part is a picturesque moment! The rooftop pool is breathtaking and is the best view in Singapore. Also, Marquee is the coolest club you’ll ever go to. A Ferris wheel and slide attached that you can’t miss.\n\nMost of all, the employees and premium services were extremely catering, helpful and fast. Shoutout to Eunice from Premium Guest Services for going above and beyond each day of my stay. She gave me all the best recommendations and she was swift with all my responses. She also assisted me with all my rides to and from the hotel with ease.\n\nThis hotel has it all!

From the minute we arrived we were met at the door and escorted to our rooms where check in took place which was seamless and so efficient. The rooms are out of this world and spotless and the attention to detail was fantastic. Breakfast is superb! The staff are incredible from the pool staff to the restaurants staff but the best service we had was we had booked a departure transfer to the airport which was late arriving due to a mix up but was handled very well. When we arrived at the airport there were 2 staff members from the hotel waiting for us to assist us to the tax refund and check in- I have never had such service in my 45 years in the industry all I can say if you can stay at this hotel it is a once in a lifetime experience.\n\nThank you for making our trip memorable!",

        "review_text": "The hotel is getting old. The elevator stopped where it wanted to, but not where you wanted to go. There was construction on our floor. 44th floor, Tower 3. Jackhammers all day. Unbearable. We weren't told about it. Discount? Nonsense. They just smiled and ignored it. Resting during the day was impossible. The room was stylish, but totally impractical. Only a fixed shower head. You can't clean your bottom or the soles of your feet. Taps with separate hot and cold water. You never find the right mix. The tap is much too close to the sink. Washing your hands is impossible. The toilet is nice and open. You can see in from every side (who likes that?) and it stinks so much in the whole room. There is just one chair in the room that you can sit on. The seating area is also stylish, but just as impractical to sit on. And you can't reach the \"salon table\" unless you're over 2 meters tall. I'm \"only\" 167 cm tall. So no chance.\nThe only thing that's great is the view from the 44th floor. Everything else didn't convince me. It's all very overpriced and not worth the price.\nThe breakfast buffet is huge but mostly designed for Asians. For Europeans, it's not worth the exorbitant price. Here you get a 3-course meal.\nThere is no hotel lobby for guests. As a hotel guest, you can't charge your electronic device anywhere (except in your own room). It happened to me when I had to leave the room but had paid until the end of the day. Very bad service for the year 2024, when you can only do everything electronically.\nConclusion: Once and never again.\nBy the way: You can access the top floor (57th floor) where the swimming pool is if you rent such an expensive room, but I personally never found a place by the swimming pool, let alone at the bar, because everything was occupied all day. Nobody mentions that. In no brochure, on no website. Another weak point for a lot of money.",

But even though there are lots of people, the customer service team have a knack for seeking you out amongst the crowd to see if you need anything. How they manage to know who is who is beyond me. Room is impressive. But the real highlight is of course the infinity pool and deck. It’s magnificent and the service that comes with it is what makes it so iconic. Thank you to Christy who treated my 5 year old son like he was royalty. Despite the price, the deck is considerably child friendly (I thought it wouldn’t be). There is a separate adults only section to prevent annoying relaxed adults. Food and beverage was fantastic but be prepared, it’s pricey I found the cafe downstairs (Bloom) decently priced for a coffee and croissant.

So friendly and will go out of their way to assist. Ziu from the bell desk gets a 10 plus. He assisted us with our luggage when we were checking. The pool is great but the first time we went in the afternoon there were no lounge chairs anywhere near the pool. Reminds me of the situation on a cruise ship. Sky deck is on floor 56. They do not make it convenient at all for people staying at the hotel to get back to their rooms. Had to go to first floor and go back inside to get to our tower elevator. Then there is the crowds. If you are not a fan of lots of people, might want to re-think staying here. Restaurant prices are quite high and very little selection for a reasonably priced breakfast. The Origin+Bloom was close to affordable for a coffee and croissant. We had a great view to see the light show at 745pm at Gardens by the Bay.",

        "review_text": "Spent 2 nights here a a little reward for both of us after a hard 4 months. It’s not cheap but wow, it’s an amazing place. From arrival by van to a chaotic entrance, we both wondered what check in would be like. Not a worry, the whole register and check in was so fast and easy, we were both impressed. It didn’t stop there. Room not ready so given 2 cards to the Skyroof Infinity Pool. The surprises continue. It’s a massive pool spanning across the 3 towers and on the 57th floor. Plenty of chairs, lots of room in the pool and really prompt service for food and drink. A special mention for Mark who looked after us each day. The views of Singapore from the pool deck are breathtaking. One side is the City and the other side is the Harbor which resembles a full car park of ships waiting to load or unload. Received a phone call to advise our room was ready. Rooms are very well appointed as you would expect for the price. Only issue was the provided pillows were like bricks. A quick call to housekeeping and that was resolved quickly. Check out was even faster, an express reader that swallows your room cards and emails a settled account. The only suggestion we could make is there is absolute nowhere to sit in the building. Everything is expensive but as a treat very much worth the experience.",

When you open your door lights and tv turn on, curtains open. The bathroom had the most amazing toilet/ bidet which was all at the touch of a button including individually programmable. (It’s the little things)\nThe rooftop pool was beautiful. Towels, sunscreen and lemon water were there for your use. There was also drink and food service.\nThe hotel also had a walkway to the shops, casino and metro train which we used and found convenient and less expensive than taking taxis.\nThere is a little cafe which we used for breakfast and it offered tea, coffee, juice, breakfast sandwiches, yogurt etc. Simple yet filling and delicious.\nDefinitely a must stay if you are visiting Singapore",

        "review_text": "I am with my elderly parents and my older brother who flew all the way from Canada to celebrate the 87th and 81st birthday of our Dad and Mom.\nI booked the 2 Sands Premier Suite since December 2023 as I wanted to make our parents’ birthday memorable.\nI emailed the MBS to avail the Merlion Suite originally as we stayed there in July 2022 but unfortunately its apparently under renovation.\nSo I settled for the 2 Sands Premier Suite instead.\nI roped in the help of MBS n Januat 2024 to have my parents’ room decorated with flowers, balloons, birthday greetings, champagne and fruits and MBS threw in complimentary cakes as well.\nI also requested 2 wheelchairs and possible early check-in and late check out too.\n3 days before our visit to MBS , they send a reminder for out check-ins and I confirmed with then all the pre-arranged surprises for my parents.\nThe room reservation, room-in dining , Bayfloral all have confirmed that all the arrangement are smoothly on the way, although some miscommunications happened when I was confirming the arrangements but…\nWhat impressed me the most was the MBS premium services that oversee that all the arrangement will happen and more… Ms. Precious, Ms Lucy of MBS premium service and in-room dining addressed all my concerns and Ms. Maria of Bayfloral as well thru our communications via email. MBS premium services sent a message to give them a heads up once we ate on our way, as the 2 wheel chairs will be waiting for us.\nOn the day of our arrival Ms. Eunice Marasigan was waiting for us at the lobby, though I missed the message who are we supposed to meet thus, we alighted from our transportation and proceeded to request for wheelchairs. When Ms. Eunice spotted us that’s where the magic started… from the very start she assisted us with genuine warmth and sincerity, she was honest that the 2 rooms are being prepared as well as the surprises, so she lead us to RENKU for complimentary breakfast where Sheila assisted us while waiting as Eunice checked in for all of us,and provided us temporary keys for the gym and infinity pool. Since we anticipated that rooms might not be ready yet, we had a lunch reservation at RISE so Sheila of RENKU helped us move to RISE restaurant with all our complimentary drinks in tow.\nWhile having our lunch buffet at RISE, Eunice keeps us updated with our rooms( we requested if PAIZAPremier Suite is available instead but unfortunately not), she surprised my parents with cakes and birthday song compliments of RISE staffs( separate review on this).\nOnce our rooms are ready, we were led to it and MBS wowed us with the floral arrangements, balloons and birthday greetings( c/o Bayfloral) adorned the room of my parents and the fruits and Piper-Heidsieck Champagne (c/o MBS in-room dining) with complimentary MBS cakes and fruits as well. My parents were so surprised and overwhelmed!! Goal achieved!\nMs.Eunice also helped us how to go to KOMA for our dinner resevation ( separate review) and she also readied our transportation for the next day to our lunch reservation to ATLAS( another review) a complimentary limousine ride. She always updated and assured us during our stay.\nShe come across as a very genuine, sincere staffs who is going above and beyond, MBS is fortunate to have her as she will definitely brought her A game and made the guests feels very special. Kudos as well to Jeff and Jonald who assisted us on our check-out and the kind gentleman whom I forgot to get his name who drove is to ATLAS.\nWe woke up late the next day and still tired so we decided to order a in-room dining for breakfast instead of availing our complimentary brekkie to RISE and Spago. It’s very convenient to oraer thru TV and very promptly delivered. Variety of choices too. After that we went to infinity pool but to do photo shoots only as we are rushed for our next appointment.\nThank you! All in all, our MBS stay is memorable. We will defintely come back and visit again!",

We had breakfast at Rise each morning and had a special anniversary meal at Spago on the rooftop, which was outstanding!\n\nI think for what you get at this hotel, its truly value for money, the hotel staff truly care about your comfort throughout your stay and let’s be frank, there are no better views in Singapore than here.\n\nThank you to Victor and the MBS team for making our stay so special and one to remember.\n\nWe will be back!",

Construction is incredibly noisy from 9 am to 6 pm and on weekends. It is Loud. The bed is hard as a rock and I hope they change it out.\n\n2. They were working on the room above us and knocked out the air conditioning and the electric.\n3. I never complain and mentioned it a checkout saying paying $1,000 for a room with no AC and packing my bags in the dark is ridiculous.\n4 There response was we are sorry, no credit to your $1,000 room and have a nice day.\n\nThe only reason you should go to Marina Bay now is if you are dead set on the pool. The pool is great, but the construction is over the top loud and the hotel really doesn't have to care as there is always another unsuspecting guest.\n\nWe are coming to Singapore for the 4th time this year and are staying at the Mandarin Oriental this time. The only thing I'm missing out on is the Marina pool.",

        "review_text": "During our three-day stay at the Marina Bay Sands in Singapore, in a Deluxe Room Sky View, at a price of around 690 euros per night, we experienced both outstanding and in need of improvement. The room impressed with its spaciousness, floor-to-ceiling windows and a separate bathroom and toilet area, which could also be accessed independently. Although the water pressure in the shower was satisfactory, it could have been stronger for an optimal shower experience. The acoustic insulation of the bathroom, which made it possible to shower without disturbing people in the sleeping area, deserves special mention.\n\nThe breathtaking view of the city from our room, which was cleaned several times a day and provided with fresh towels, as well as the exceptionally comfortable bed, significantly enhanced our stay. A key reason for our choice of hotel was the famous rooftop pool, whose phenomenal view and nightly opening times until 11 p.m. offered an unforgettable experience. The water temperature of the pool was okay and it was not particularly crowded during the week.\n\nHowever, some experiences clouded our overall picture. The check-in process proved to be lengthy and comparable to that of an economy check-in line at the airport, with a waiting time of around 20 minutes and an additional time of around 15 minutes for the processing itself due to room issues. In addition, the digital check-in via app, which was advertised in advance, resulted in repeated error messages due to system overloads. The breakfast, although acceptable overall, did not meet the expectations of variety and quality that we are used to from comparable hotels in Bangkok. The crowded and noisy conditions in the breakfast room, as well as the cramped seating arrangement, especially indoors, diminished the dining experience. Only the outdoor area was not as tightly packed, but was affected by some traffic noise.\n\nThe location of the hotel was consistently convincing with excellent connections to the public transport network thanks to a subway station in the basement and the possibility of exploring the surrounding area easily on foot.\n\nIn summary, the Marina Bay Sands in Singapore offered an experience with ups and downs, although the hotel's unique location and exclusive amenities partially compensated for the weaknesses in service and catering.",

Arrived and as we opened the door all the automatic lights came on , curtains opened with a view across the harbour and down onto the Supertree Grove. We were celebrating a birthday which I had noted on reservation and we had a birthday cake delivered to the room by the butler. Did not even know we had one !!. Room was not ideal for 3 people but we made the best of it abd used the facilites that were on offer. They even had a karoke set up in the living room so we had a great time using that.

The hotel is very beautiful and views are great. The rooftop pool is great for the view and I think it looks better at night. The breakfast has very rich selections at the first level restaurant, and I didn't try the breakfast beside the pool. The hotel also has mall and casino, also many good restaurants.

        "review_text": "MBS is well known but in my opinion overrated. The rooms are overpriced for the type of room you get. I work remotely and take my work with me when I travel. Most 5* hotels have a business center. When I asked the front desk one of the staff was confused as to what a business center was. Another staff then said their business center is in the convention center but it’s all booked. I have a feeling they don’t really know what a business center is and that they don’t have one. I don’t mind working from the room, but I prefer working from a business center or a lounge area. There is no convenient lounge area. This hotel doesn’t even have a real lobby to rest your legs.\n\nWe were only here for a few days. We also tried their dinner buffet which was very good. Service was a bit slow though it is CNY and a busy time. When we were seated we were informed our champagne would be served right away. It was about after our second round of getting food that our champagne was actually served. Then when we paid the bill our server asked for us to stay at our dining table so they can double check our room number is correct. After waiting for 5-10 minutes the server never came back to let us know we can leave. We had to hunt down help to confirm it was okay to leave the dining area.\n\nThe other area we accessed was the pool. The worker “Vicky” was checking in guests. I understand the pool is for guests only and you need to swipe a card per adult guest. I have three kids and they claimed my two teenagers ages 15 and 16 are adults. And they would “let me in this time” but next time to register them so they have their own hotel room card to access the pool. I’ve never heard of such a ridiculous requirement and shouldn’t this be something when we were checking in that the front desk advise us of?\n\nThe hotel is conveniently located with lots of things to do. But I do not consider this place family friend or work travel friendly and likely will not be coming back.",

She is the nicest hotel employee I have ever met! I really appreciate it, thank you very much. In addition to impeccable cleaning, a pleasant smell that fills the room, and sufficient amenities, there are also ample hotel facilities. This is exactly the hotel stay we were looking for. I have never had such a wonderful experience. This is definitely the best hotel. It's worth visiting Singapore just to stay at this hotel. I will definitely stay again. it is really amazing! !",

        "review_text": "The CNY period is busy for everyone, but most luxury hotels find a way to manage. Not true for Marina Bay Sands. The check in experience has been appallingly bad.\n\nTo not have any rooms available until 3 pm is understandable, albeit inconvenient - but to not have a single seating area available for guests to wait in is absolutely unconscionable. There are ZERO chairs / couches anywhere on the first floor, they've decided to monetize by giving every last inch to the buffet.\n\nMy elderly parents are traveling with us, and we had to walk around for 30 minutes looking for a place to sit. We finally squeezed in a beach in the food court area in the mall to wait an hour for our rooms.\n\nI was then called, and specifically told ALL three rooms we booked were available (I made sure to ask). We all walked back (again - a long distance) to be told, just kidding, only one of the three was currently available. What should my elderly parents do in that case?\n\nFinally, even after we made it to the rooms - it was literally a 45 minute wait for our luggage to arrive.\n\nI have traveled extensively around the globe, and Marina Bay Sands ranks amongst the very bottom. They have an iconic location, the views are nice, the service staff have been trained to smile and say nice things - but it is far, far from a luxurious experience.",

        "review_text": "The main reason I chose this hotel for the second time, is the marvellous infinity pool. Be sure to spend at least a few hours in the pool and jacuzzi. This location is unique for great pictures and videos. Before sunrise and sunset are not to be missed.\n\nThe hotel itself is enormous, but most (like the delicious restaurants, the Shoppes and the shows) is also accessible to non-hotel guests. So, make sure to explore this hotel, even if you’re not a guest, it’s an experience in itself.\n\nThe staff is very friendly, giving tips and helping out when necessary. One time I got out of the pool at 23:51, and my belongings (luckily only my room card inside my hotel bathjacket) were taken away prematurely. So be aware of this if you intend to stay in the pool until midnight to not lose your valuables! I thus had to go to the first floor with a new jacket and towel I had received by the staff at the pool to obtain a new room card.\n\nBreakfast was very expensive, so if you consider having breakfast, try allocating more time and making a brunch out of it at the Rise restaurant. This way, you kinda get 2 meals for the same price, which makes it more affordable.\n\nThe room was good, with a nice view on Gardens By The Bay for us. I would have liked a movable spray head in the shower though, as a fixed one is not handy.\n\nThe fitness is good enough with various machines, and helps you keep in shape for the duration of your stay.\n\nThe hotel is expensive though, which is normal for the luxury you obtain in return. The reason which refrains me from giving this hotel 5 stars, is the absurd price of purchasing the photos a photographer has taken of you at the pool itself. The cheapest option was 120 SGD and to get all your photos digitally too, the price becomes 145 SGD, if I am not mistaken. I get that they know their audience is whealthy (otherwise they wouldn’t be able to afford such an expensive hotel), but to me it really feels like a tourist trap. It’s not like the photographer stayed 15 minutes with you to capture you from all the best angles. It was just a minute, some poses at the same spot, and that’s it. Feels like bandwork and not worth more than 20 SGD. Even though, I purchased the photos because I am fascinated by your infinity pool, but it gave a bitter aftertaste which damped my experience a bit.\n\nShout-out to Fir (@firtography1985 on Instagram) though, who volunteered to make great photos of us at the pool at sunrise with our phone!\n\nConclusion: I will certainly come back in the future because I love Singapore, Marina Bay, the restaurants and the Infinity Pool, but reviewing your paid photograph service at the pool would be a good thing.",

Just to contextualise my stay, I was only at MBS to take some important work calls and to relax while my house was under renovation, but I ended up having to experience so much stress from:\n1. A security breach issue that I encountered with someone else (not my guest or I) who definitely came into our room to eat one of our snacks in the mini-bar area and subsequently left the empty package beside the room refrigerator (see photo attached);\n2. Equipment in my room not working (Netflix not syncing to the TV screen in the room);\n3. Billing issues throughout my stay (where I had to spend more than half my stay calling or emailing their reservations team and also going down to the check-in counter at least 3 times in-person to get my billing issue resolved)\n4. Not having the room service staff provide me with my birthday amenity first thing upon check-in (the friend who booked my room at MBS kept asking if the hotel did anything for me and I had to wait for hours and ask twice before anything came to my room, and my friend who did my room booking was severely disappointed that I didn’t receive anything for a long while although he put a note in for this upon booking my room);\n5. Not having my Sands Lifestyle rewards membership card credited with the rewards dollars within 48 hours of my check-out (I am still following up on this issue…)\n\nA Nicole Yu from the hotel’s recovery team has done an investigation into the security breach issue where someone in their staff team entered my room to eat from my snack bar (but not to make up my room) while I was away from my room for lunch on the second day of my stay, but they claimed none of the staff who entered my room ate the snack (then who did, a ghost?) and informed me that they couldn’t do anything else for me as I had checked out of the hotel (the issue wasn’t resolved before I checked out anyway…so whose fault is that)? She said I could come back again to experience the hotel but why would I pay to return when I had such a stressful stay at a hotel that a) Isn’t cheap and b) is supposedly iconic to Singapore?\n\nI have photos to share of the empty nut package by my fridge which I discovered in my room, and would like to escalate this matter to someone more senior within the hotel, but Nicole has ghosted me for the past 24 hours. I am only posting here because I haven’t had my issues resolved and am still waiting for someone from their team to get back to me.\n\nIf you’re thinking of staying at the hotel, be warned…the service is appalling and you’re paying top dollar for this. Just save yourself the stress and the trouble - there are many other better hotels for this price point in Singapore (I’ve stayed in a fair number of them especially given I am a local)!",

        "review_text": "We had the most outstanding experience at Marina Bay Sands. From the moment we checked in, the hospitality, friendliness and service was exceptional.\n\nYve who checked us in was knowledgeable, attentive and her customer service skills were excellent. Once checked into our suite, Marvin our Butler greeted us at the lifts and escorted us to our room. We're very grateful for Marvin's enthusiasm for his role, his friendliness and excellent service. Nothing was too much trouble as he helped organise our stay from booking a poolside cabana, afternoon drinks & canapes and a sunrise breakfast to name a few of the experiences. He even hand made a beautiful birthday card and brought us a delicious cake to acknowledge and celebrate the birthday event which was the reason for our trip.\n\nEvery aspect of our suite was superbly luxurious and included amazing city and sea views. Relaxing by the Infinity Pool overlooking the beautiful city views of Singapore was also a highlight.\n\nWherever we went, the staff were friendly, engaging and nothing was too much trouble. Club @ Renku, Spago, Ce La Vie, Concierge & Luggage services, Poolside Bar, Limousine service, Yve, Marvin and Christelle at the airport...across all these areas, it is true to say customer service at Marina Bay Sands is outstanding.\n\nThank you again to everyone at Marina Bay Sands. This was an experience we will never forget.\n\nGary and Anne",

And the view of the city from the room is worth every penny spent on this hotel. We read bad reviews and were afraid to go, but absolutely in vain. The room has everything you need, a free minibar with water, juices and chips, a coffee machine.\nWell, you don’t even have to comment about the pool. Perfect white soft towels, good service. Probably the only negative is the lack of umbrellas for the sun loungers. Probably on purpose so that they don’t lie there for a long time 😁.\nAs for breakfasts. Breakfast in two locations: on the ground floor and on 57. Never go to 57 😁, on the ground floor there are excellent breakfasts with a huge selection, on 57 there is nothing to eat 😁, very little choice.",

The first bar we tried at the top of tower 1 was closed for a private function. We were advised to try the bar at the top of tower 3. Went there only to be advised that if we wanted to sit at one of the reserved tables, and they were all reserved, there was a minimum spend of $1000. Being just my wife and I we were not going to get anywhere near this. Absolutely ridiculous for a hotel that claims to care about the customer experience! We had booked in for 4 nights and thought it might be nice to move to a hotel that actually cares about their guests only to be told that we could get a refund for the unused nights it would take 4 weeks to process. Ended up having a drink in a restaurant on the ground floor, not the 57th floor with all the views. This hotel claims it’s 5 star but in terms of their attitude to their paying guests they are not even one star. My recommendation is to find a hotel where they actually care about their guests.",

For the room we chose Deluxe with garden bay view reserved price 1008sg and paid 1017sg ??, large room well equipped and magnificent view (we were allocated a smoking room???). There was a nice touch for the birthday, a cake was served to us in our room. Breakfast either on the ground floor or on the 57th floor near the huge swimming pool, small buffet with hot and cold drinks, various dishes served on the table by very pleasant staff.\nThe swimming pool on the 57th floor is magnificent, be careful the deckchair mattresses are not always very clean.\nI wanted at least one night (CT for a gift) in this establishment because the price is very high, and in the end I would not have stayed there more.

The 4 stars were mostly due to the hotel architecture itself. It is a beautiful, well designed hotel, rooms are really nice and very modern, with lots of upgrades.\n\nNow for the negatives. The hotel was extremely busy so check-in process took a very long time. In fact we had two rooms and one of the rooms was not ready for hours. The rooftop pool on the top of the hotel was crazy busy. We could not find a place to sit. Looks like there are a lot of one night stay guest who just want to experience the hotel for a night. The breakfast buffer on the top floor next to the rooftop pool left a lot to be desired. The breakfast was not that great. We expected better for the quality of the hotel. We asked for a late checkout and was told no late checkout allowed. We spent good money for two rooms and thought one hour late checkout was not a lot to ask for. They did offer to store our luggage and provide a room to change but we could not stay in our room for an hour extra.\n\nIt is a pretty pricey hotel. Nice hotel and its really a choice if you want to spend the high price to stay there. The services could have been better for such a pricey hotel.",

Mr Cornelius was very kind and polite when we checked-in.\nWhen we are in the infinity pool, Mr Dennis, Mr Ramon and Ms Vicky were very friendly and courteous, especially Mr. Dennis.\nMr. Dennis has showed the hospitality trait of being a Filipino. He always checks on us and other guests if we are okay and enjoying the infinity pool.

I had some trouble pre-registering with the APP and she was able to overcome all of that and not only solved the problem, but some how, and for some reason, was able to upgrade us to a VIP room. I have traveled my entire working career and have had some nice upgrades but nothing compared to this. Two room Suite, with butler, and to many amenities to count.\n\nGreat room, great bed, great TV's (yes, biggest TV's in a hotel ever)\n\nGreat room service.\n\nNo need to comment about the pool, it is every bit as iconic as people say.\n\nService is second to none.\n\nWe will certainly be back and highly recommend this for a special event.",

They go above and beyond to get the job done. Daily room tidy up services are what I’ve never seen anywhere before, each time you go back to the room, you see like a brand new facility.

        "review_text": "When you book at the Marina you don't book a room, but you book an experience....our experience begins by arriving by taxi in the hall which has six taxi lanes. Once you have stopped, the hotel attendants open the door for you and unload your bags.\nThey accompany you to the hall where they issue a coupon to identify your suitcase which you will find in the room. At the check inn you are offered water and chupa chups, and while they enter your passport details, they ask you how your trip went and tell you about your room. Our room was a Deluxe city view on the 25th floor, approximately halfway up the skyscraper, in fact it has 57 floors where the iconic swimming pool stands majestically on the top. Upon entering you have a long corridor where the bathroom is located on the right with 3 separate areas, for toilet, shower and king sink. Continuing we arrive at the large and comfortable bed where we have a nice 75 TV at the front, which I didn't watch since the view of the skyline was much better. Desk and minibar included complete the room.\nTo give you an idea, the whole complex is taller than the Eiffel Tower.\nThe swimming pool, exclusive only for hotel guests, rests on 3 towers, our room was in tower 3. Below the hotel is the shopping center with restaurants and all branded shops, casino and theatre. In the evening you can see the show with the fountains dancing in the water or the lights of the trees in the garden bay. The next morning breakfast is at the \"Lo Spago\" restaurant next to the swimming pool on the 57th floor, by presenting your room card you are accompanied to the table, it could be the low Japanese one, or the normal one. You order drinks from the waiter and go independently to the large buffet area. Breakfast is mostly savory, but there are croissants, chocolate croissants, bread and the inevitable Nutella. I also tasted some excellent pancakes with maple juice, cream and jam. Juices, coffee and cappuccino are a must.\nCheck out is at 12, the bags are collected in the room and the magnetic keys are delivered quickly, just insert them into the totem. Of course the experience is not within everyone's reach, but it is definitely worth the cost.",

Considering how much it costs to stay in this hotel I would now pay to stay here with the constant drilling sounds vibrating above us.\n\nThere are so many hotels in Singapore, which are much better value for money. If you’re looking for a relaxing experience do not stay here.\n\nTrust me, the pool is not worth paying to stay here.",

Shie (I hope I spelled her name right) was welcoming and efficient when we checked in. She asked us what we wanted. We entered a clean, orderly, and well designed room on the 37th floor with many amenities we favored. There was juice and water in the refrigerator. The Nespresso was stocked with ample pods. There was tea. These were replenished daily. Our bathroom was spacious and stocked. The shower was comfortable. The bed was a tad firm for my bony frame but my husband was ok with it, he said. We got comfortably rested each night. The housekeeping staff were always polite and asked us about our stay. They offered to help each time.\nOur view was the garden by the Bay. This inspired us to walk the paths daily (except during heavy rain). Breakfast was brought up by my husband each morning from Origin+Bloom, which was located on the lobby. Such fun! Loved their Bircher muesli and my flat white. My husband had something new each morning.\nWe toured the top floor where the pool and other amenities were. The view was lovely.",

Magnificent room with oversized bed, balcony and view. After putting on our bathrobes, we are at the swimming pool with a panoramic view of Singapore. We swim and enjoy the sunset. Dinner outside because too expensive for us. The next day 6:30 a.m., sunrise, but we are not the first. Breakfast on our balcony, facing the bay. We leave the hotel at 11:00 a.m., the long check-out limit. We made the most of our short stay in this fabulous hotel.",

What was NOT expected was the horrendous construction that was going on upstairs flooding our entire room.\n\nI was so angry. On booking, I paid a small additional sum for my 6month old baby as a ‘guest’. I notified them that we have a baby, and they even put a cot and a baby bath in the room EXCEPT they also put us downstairs from 9-6 construction. My little baby, who is meant to do 3-4naps a day would not stop crying and both my husband and I had to escalate escalate escalate over a 3hr period, where I ended up sitting in the hallway in tears too, before we were given an adequate replacement room by one of the Guest Service Managers, Xavier. Terrible experience; having stayed at MBS many times in the past - I was shocked at their oversight and the time it took to rectify.\n\nOther reasons for my rating include a very mediocre breakfast. The chef we had on both mornings couldn’t get our omelettes right (we wanted fresh eggs, instead of the pre-made egg mix and egg whites); we end up just eating croissants and mini muffins that were pretty dry.\n\nMBS is in a perfect location for shopaholics: that is one of the reason I maintained the 3 stars rating.",

The beds were so hard and felt like sleeping on wood. Bath towels were small and felt like sandpaper. When we provided our feedback to the hotel their response was that rooms in our tower 3 had not been renovated unlike rooms in tower 1 and 2 so they offered us a token $100 credit.\nCheck in took 40 minutes to find interconnecting rooms for our young children. Incredibly they first suggested we take rooms on the opposite sides of the floor.\n20 minute wait for seating at breakfast. I could go on. Lesson learnt, will not be staying here again.",

It is beautifully designed with all the modern fittings and fixtures, and well catered to feel like a luxury home away from home. We have stayed in many luxury hotels around the world, but never had a room with 75inch TV, a tea bar and cocktail bar. I could write forever about how much we loved the room and all the fantastic amenities.\n\nThe hotel itself also ticked all the boxes. With shopping, restaurants, train and tourist attractions at its doorsteps, there's a lot to do without travelling very far.\n\nThe swim in the infinity pool certainly did not disappoint. The views from the pool are simply breathtaking and impossible to stop taking photos from all angles at different times of the day and night.\n\nAll the staff were friendly, efficient and always went above and beyond.\n\nWe were very spoilt to have the opportunity to stay here and we can't wait to return!",
