This is the best hotel in Singapore. It might even be top 5 in the world.

The view is the most breathtaking view (if you hate heights, maybe it’s not for you, or pick a lower floor, or close the blinds)
It feels like you are on an adventure with the amount of activity you get to do.
And yes, the infinity pool is stunning, you literally feel like you are on the edge of the world.
This hotel is so good, one can take it as a bucket list item.

The hotel is so large that it took me an hour from the time I walked through the front door to the time I reached my room, which left me exhausted.
The hotel has just undergone a major renovation, so it's beautiful, but the view isn't great. The bed is so high I'm scared of falling off.

The amenities are high-quality, including nail clippers and perfume. The tea provided is from a high-end tea shop in Singapore, which is impressive, but I was disappointed that I had to pay to use the luxurious-looking tea set.
The rooftop restaurant was extremely crowded and full of excited customers, which made it difficult to relax. The food court was also extremely crowded, with children squealing and yelling, which made it difficult to relax. I went to a pizza place, but it was just too expensive.

On the last night before returning to China, we were tired from playing during the day, so we washed up early and coaxed the baby to sleep. At about 22:30, a girlfriend who was traveling with me suddenly told me that her room was broken into by a stranger with a card. Fortunately, the door was locked with a chain, otherwise the consequences for a mother with a child would be unimaginable. Recalling several recent ** incidents in Southeast Asia, she decided to take her child (she didn't dare to leave the child alone in the room) to the front desk to negotiate in fear and anger. And I didn't dare to fall asleep in the room, staring at my phone to watch her synchronize the negotiations at the front desk.

She brought her child to the lobby to negotiate with the duty manager. What is infuriating is that the duty manager Clintson did not even offer a halfhearted consolation. The front desk even admitted that someone had indeed illegally broken into the room, but refused to let us retrieve the surveillance video, nor did they admit that there were any safety hazards in the hotel. They only replied that they would deal with it tomorrow (and asked her to go back to the room to sleep. Who would dare to take the child back to the room to sleep with a stranger breaking into the room at night?) After repeated communication failed, we could only call the police and hope for fair coordination by the police. Soon a young police officer came to the scene. After asking about the situation, he actually said that the police did not care about such incidents inside the hotel, and there was no need to check the surveillance. We just needed to change the room. It was almost two o'clock in the morning. We were exhausted physically and mentally, and the child was drowsy in the wheelchair. Speechless and helpless, the three mothers could only swallow their anger and take the children back to the room to rest in a foreign country, and they had no sleep all night. . .

The next day, the hotel replied that they could give us a room with breakfast and airport transfer. We asked, ""If the hotel is not at fault and has no guilty conscience, why should it compensate us?"" On the flight back to China, I wrote this paragraph, not for any compensation, but just hoping that the hotel can apologize sincerely.

As a germaphobe, I didn't even use the sheets I brought with me. I also prepared two pairs of good quality disposable slippers, although I didn't use them. The bathroom supplies are also one of the most abundant I have ever seen in a hotel.

The environment is also perfect, with the bay cityscape on one side and the bay garden landscape on the other. The difference is not big, both are beautiful. The underground level is directly connected to the subway station, and there is also a luxury shopping mall that is the same size as the first floor of the hotel. Of course, the most worthwhile thing to visit is the sky garden and infinity swimming pool on the roof, which can account for at least 1/3 of the house price😂

The service is first-class. I stayed for one night and received a bunch of bottled water and snacks.

As a germaphobe, I didn't even use the sheets I brought with me. I also prepared two pairs of good quality disposable slippers, although I didn't use them. The bathroom supplies are also one of the most abundant I have ever seen in a hotel.

The environment is also perfect, with the bay cityscape on one side and the bay garden landscape on the other. The difference is not big, both are beautiful. The underground level is directly connected to the subway station, and there is also a luxury shopping mall that is the same size as the first floor of the hotel. Of course, the most worthwhile thing to visit is the sky garden and infinity swimming pool on the roof, which can account for at least 1/3 of the house price😂

The service is first-class. I stayed for one night and received a bunch of bottled water and snacks.

Singapore’s tourism industry is full during the Spring Festival. Everyone knows that services will inevitably be discounted. We are also mentally prepared in this regard.

However, the other five-star hotels I visited during the same period (Maldives and Kuala Lumpur) still have a clear sense of service, and tourists are basically fine if they are a little patient.

The only MBS that costs NT$9,000 per night is out of stock. We spent 60,000 yuan for three rooms for two nights, but we received unsatisfactory service experience everywhere.

On the first day I checked in, I was informed that I had to wait for an hour before I could check in because the room was full. Of course I understood this. But there is no place to stay in the entire hall, not a bench or a sofa. Note: It does not mean that it is occupied by others, but it does not exist at all. Every square meter is given to profitable restaurants and coffee shops. It's okay to let us spend money, but we can't sit in the restaurant because we missed our meal. Every corner is occupied by embarrassed passengers, which reminds me of the Spring Festival Railway Station.

What should we do with our two 80-year-olds? The front desk can only suggest hypocritically that we can go to the food court in the nearby shopping mall to take a seat... Okay. After walking for 20 minutes, I found that the food court was also full. After an embarrassing 15 minutes of waiting, I was finally able to settle down. I was already feeling dissatisfied, so I bought some snacks to calm down my panic and try to think of the best.

An hour later the call came - the room was ready for us to move in. I confirmed again, are all three sets of rooms ready? Everyone set sail again and walked for 20 minutes back to the front desk... ***, in fact, only one room was available. What about the elders? Go back to the food court and take a seat? Speechless.

If you leave a message to express your dissatisfaction, you should also acknowledge that the management takes it seriously and sends you a box of chocolates to express your apology. We don’t want to cause trouble, and we want to be peaceful during the New Year. But every time I interact with hotel staff, I get angry.

- My 15-year-old son went to the swimming pool with my wife without his room card and was refused permission.
- The room card expired the next morning and I had to go to the front desk to reactivate it. This little thing also caused many questions.
- After finishing the buffet and signing the bill, we were told that we were not allowed to leave and had to confirm our identity (not a very friendly tone, but the request was understandable). But after the confirmation, should we come over and tell us that we can leave?

The high-voltage test can only give them a zero score. If you want to enjoy luxury, it is highly recommended to stay next to Ritz, Oriental Mandarin, and Four Seasons.

After the procedures are completed, you will be given a temporary card, you can go to the top floor and so on, and you will call when the room is ready. We checked in at 11 o'clock, and we called to inform us that we could move in as soon as we walked to the Science Museum. After we visited the Science Museum, we went to the shopping center in the third district to buy lunch and then went back to the hotel to eat. There are various luxury stores, restaurants, and theaters in the shopping center in the third district. The basement floor is a food court. There are dozens of stores that are not duplicated, and the prices are reasonable, but there are too many people and it is difficult to find a seat. There are also separate restaurants on the upper floors, such as Cantonese cuisine, steak, Vietnamese cuisine, etc. The environment is better and the price is more expensive. There is also a **** on the basement level, which can be entered for free with a passport and entry form. There is also a subway station on the basement level, and the bus on the ground is also very convenient. There are Merlion Park, Ferris Wheel, and other scenic spots around, you can walk there or take a few bus stops. The room itself is okay, it is rare in this price range without a bathtub, only a shower. There are coffee machines, water heaters, a lot of drinking water, about seven or eight bottles, and free drinks and snacks. The TV is the largest in the hotel I have stayed in, it should be 75 inches. The noise problem is very serious. The hotel is located in the middle of the driveway, and there is a constant flow of vehicles throughout the day. There are also a lot of vehicles at 3 in the morning, and the accelerator is still on. Those who have poor sleep quality must wear earplugs, and may not sleep well all night. The most important selling point is the infinity swimming pool on the top floor. Wear a swimsuit in your own room, take the elevator to the 57th floor, and need to take the elevator once in the middle. You have to swipe your room card when you take the elevator and enter the swimming pool, one person at a time, so there are several room cards Bring them all. You can take large bath towels at the entrance, you can take two, one for the other. You can sit on any empty chairs, and you can go into the water after you put your things down. The scenery is indeed beautiful, and the surrounding scenery is unobstructed. Everyone is taking pictures, and I am the only one swimming. The pool above the No. 3 tower is an adult pool, and children under the age of 16 are not allowed to enter, so it is relatively quieter. If you take your children to the No. 1 and No. 2 pools, it is more lively. The waiter will ask around with the menu. If you want to order drinks, beer and snacks, you can ask the waiter to order. Sometimes the waiter will hold a bullet cup with a drink or fruit in it, just one bite, that is free and you can eat it with confidence. There are several restaurants next to the swimming pool.

衞生：剛拿到房卡一進房間就一股發黴的臭味，我們馬上聯繫了客房部，他們説是馬上安排人過來處理，結果等了一會，來了個人帶了個像空氣加濕器一樣的東西説先插上，看有沒有改善，如果沒有他們再做處理。我就納悶，你這明顯就是地毯沒處理好，一股發黴的臭味就這小機器能有什麼用，我也沒多説，趕着出去吃飯，就出門了。等到晚上回房間的時候，一打開門，一股刺鼻的香水味，我才知道，他們就是這樣處理的，我帶着一個兩歲的娃，這刺鼻的香水味我聞着都頭疼，孩子怎麼睡呢？於是我馬上打電話聯繫換房，酒店給安排換到了49樓的另一個房間，這個房間裏雖然沒有那股黴臭味了，但是49樓一整層都是一股塑膠的臭味，説不出來的感覺，就像剛從樹上割下的乳膠，反正很難聞，我半夜好幾次被這個味道臭醒

環境：房間很舊，很舊很舊很舊，根本不值這個價錢，並且房間內各種東西看起來都很low，除了電梯看起來高級一點，其他的都無力吐槽，我去澳門凼仔隨便一個酒店都比他這個強多了，最奇葩的是，馬桶旁邊居然沒有洗屁股的噴頭，我的天吶


服務：這是唯一能接受的，就是他們的服務很好，有求必應，但是有點怪的是，很多中國員工，前台辦入住的是中國人，客房打掃的也是中國人，説英文他們都聽不懂，都是中國北方的普通話口音。

這是今生第一次住這個酒店，也是最後一次。
五千多一晚，生日佈置還需要自費，就這麼幾個氣球，收了大約750元人民幣，呵呵呵。",2025-09-08 22:50:58,zh-TW,"Facilities: The hotel&#39;s interior facilities were not very good, very ordinary, not even comparable to five-star hotels costing one or two thousand yuan a night. The Sands is even more expensive than the Ritz-Carlton, which was very disappointing. Cleanliness: As soon as we got our room card and entered the room, we were greeted by a musty smell. We immediately contacted housekeeping, and they said they would send someone to take care of it. After a while, someone arrived with what looked like a humidifier and said they&#39;d plug it in and see if it improved. If not, they&#39;d come back. I was puzzled, thinking, &quot;It&#39;s obvious the carpet isn&#39;t properly maintained. What good is a small device for a musty smell?&quot; I didn&#39;t say much, rushing out to dinner, so I left. When I returned to the room that night and opened the door, I was greeted by a pungent perfume. I realized this was how they treated it. With a two-year-old in tow, the pungent perfume gave me a headache. How could the child sleep? So I immediately called to change rooms, and the hotel arranged to move me to another room on the 49th floor. Although this room didn&#39;t have the moldy smell, the entire floor was filled with a plastic odor. I can&#39;t describe it, like latex freshly cut from a tree. It was terrible. I was woken up several times in the middle of the night by the smell. Environment: The room was very old, very old, very old. It was not worth the price at all. Everything in the room looked very low-end. Except for the elevator, which looked a little more upscale, I can&#39;t complain about anything else. Any hotel I went to in Taipa, Macau was much better than this one. The most bizarre thing was that there was no shower head next to the toilet to wash your butt. Oh my god. Service: This is the only acceptable thing. Their service is very good and responsive. But it&#39;s a bit strange that many of the staff are Chinese. The front desk check-in staff is Chinese, and the housekeepers are also Chinese. They can&#39;t understand English when I speak. They all speak Mandarin with a northern Chinese accent. This is my first time staying at this hotel in my life, and it will also be my last. It costs more than 5,000 yuan per night, and you have to pay for the birthday decorations yourself. Just for a few balloons, it cost about 750 yuan, haha."

There are no street signs in the center. The breakfast costs 52 per person. There are very few types of mostly Western food. There is no hot noodle soup suitable for Chinese food. The rooftop swimming pool is just for enjoying the view from the top of the building. In fact, the swimming pool is not big and it is not interesting. If you don’t consider the high-altitude scenery, it will feel the same as an ordinary swimming pool. It will be boring to play for half an hour. There are very few Chinese-speaking waiters in the hotel. If you check in in the morning, you have to wait until after 3 pm to go to the room. You have to wait for the hotel's email notification. Travel is inconvenient. The price/performance ratio is not recommended."

總之，可以體驗",2025-09-08 22:56:24,zh-TW,"The 57th-floor infinity pool is a selling point. The view is great, and the experience is excellent, especially the night view overlooking the entire city. We arrived around 11 PM and booked a room with a pool view, overlooking the Gardens by the Bay and Marina Bay. Other luxury hotels aren&#39;t as good as newer hotels, given how rapidly technology advances. The unrenovated rooms are even worse. Because it&#39;s connected to the subway mall and serves as the entrance to the 56th-floor skydeck, the hotel lobby is incredibly crowded. Breakfast is available on the first floor or on the 57th floor of Tower 2. The front desk told me there&#39;s more variety on the first floor, but I didn&#39;t go because it was too noisy. The 57th floor offers some views, is semi-open-air, airy, and comfortable. The variety isn&#39;t great, but I usually settle for toast, eggs, and coffee. Overall, it&#39;s worth the experience."

When waiting in line to check in, the waiter brought a tray full of MM beans and lollipops for guests to choose from. When they saw children, they would also give them handmade cardboard books from Singapore, which instantly made guests with children feel happy. The room facilities were neither surprising nor shocking. It is said that this is because Tower 3 is an old building and not newly renovated, so it is just average. I wonder if Tower 1 and 2 are better, as they are said to be newly renovated. The infinity pool is probably used for taking pictures, and few people swim around in it.

The infinity pool wasn&#39;t very crowded in late January. We visited the children&#39;s area at 4:00 PM and 7:00 PM, respectively.

房間各方面環境衞生都不錯，就是房間沒有高一點的電插頭能提供給寶寶的自帶熱水壺燒水，插頭都比較矮，燒熱水很怕寶寶會碰到。
最後其實我想説酒店是給客人提供家一樣環境的地方，讓客人在酒店感受到的是舒適，而不是任何事情就沒得商量，並且不人道的。",2025-09-08 22:57:45,zh-TW,"We went to breakfast. My baby had a cold, so we didn&#39;t eat much during breakfast. To avoid delaying the hotel restaurant&#39;s clearing of the tables and chairs, and out of a desire to avoid wasting food, we decided to take the baby&#39;s half bowl of porridge to the room to eat while we packed and checked out. However, the restaurant manager strongly objected, saying it would be a safety issue to take food out. I understand. I asked the female manager if they could ask a staff member to bring a small portion of porridge up for us, since the baby needed something to eat, and it wouldn&#39;t be a safety issue if their staff brought it themselves. However, the female manager was adamant and a bit impatient, saying even a sick child wouldn&#39;t work, with no room for negotiation. I believe a hotel with such a high star rating earns its reputation through excellent facilities, excellent service, and problem-solving skills, not rigid rules. If they don&#39;t even show this level of understanding, it&#39;s hard to choose your hotel again. Feeling my communication was fruitless, I told her I wanted to speak with the manager, but she said she was the manager. I said I&#39;d file a complaint, and she contacted another manager. The manager was very friendly. He explained the situation to me, understood our needs, and said he would have a colleague bring some porridge to our room. We waited almost an hour but it still didn&#39;t arrive, so we checked out. However, I was quite satisfied with the manager&#39;s attitude and the way he resolved the issue. The room was clean and tidy in every way, except that there wasn&#39;t a high electrical outlet for our baby&#39;s kettle. The outlets were quite low, and I was worried the baby would touch them. Ultimately, I think a hotel is a place that provides guests with a home-like environment and a sense of comfort, not an uncompromising and inhumane approach."

3.所謂的網紅無邊泳池。記得不要白天去，否則一個卧榻都搶不到，衹能像服務生送飲料一樣滿世界找啊找，半小時都沒找到，回去了，不遊了。晚上八點以後稍微好點。
4.退房。通過攜程和自己打電話，晚一分鐘退房也不行。
總結：永不再來，這點錢住洲際和凱賓不香嗎？無邊泳池新加坡好多酒店都有啊？有人説智商税是窮人的偽概念，但是貨不對版花冤枉錢有意思嗎？
這種酒店就不要放在黃金位置推薦了，想送錢的自然會去秀朋友圈。更好的體驗不值得去這裏。

For years I've written reviews that are almost always positive and short, but today for the first time I'm going to post negative + long one.
1. check in. Your Cell phone power should be sufficient - because you need to queue for at least twenty minutes, it is really hard to get through without refresh your phone. There are two check-in desks, depending on whether you're in Tower 1, 2 or 3, otherwise you'll have to walk five minutes with your luggages in tow across the lobby to the other side to check in. You'll also be pleasantly surprised at the sheer volume of people coming and going, gamblers, shoppers, tourists, and residents mingling in the hotel lobby with all sorts of loud noises that make your brain hurt. Finally it's your turn, you will find a front desk check-in average time of ten minutes, plus there are nagging front desk and guests love to chat, justwait for it.
2.Room. Although before coming to know there is no bathtub, but rushed to other hardware and location, thought more than four thousand a night hotel can still say, which thought - no bath gel and shampoo, to call to be; disposable slippers looks comparable to domestic fast hotels; The toilet and the shower are interconnected, if one person goes to toilet, the whole family need to wait patiently outside; toothbrush It is even more breathtaking, the cost is not more than a few RMB, the express hotel is not as good. At least it is Sands, is it necessary to be so bad?
3. The so-called net red infinity pool. Remember not to go during the daytime, otherwise a couch can not be grabbed, you look like a waiter to send drinks all over the world, half an hour later, I did not find, so went back. After eight o'clock in the evening is slightly better.
4. Check out. Through Ctrip and my own phone calls, a minute late cannot be dalayed, you have to go on time.
Summarize: never come back again, the same amount of money for staying in the Intercontinental and Kempinski is much better than here. Some people say that the IQ tax is a poor man's pseudo-concept, but the goods are not the right version of the money spent in vain is still so rediculious.
This kind of hotel should not be placed in the golden position recommended, sb who wants to give away money will naturally go to show friends circle by Wechat. A better experience is not worth going here.",2025-09-08 22:59:04,zh-TW,"For years, my reviews have been mostly positive and short. Today, for the first time, I&#39;m going to write a long, negative review. 1. Make sure your phone is fully charged when you check in—you&#39;ll have to wait in line for at least twenty minutes, and it&#39;s incredibly difficult to not check your phone. There are two check-in desks, depending on whether you&#39;re staying in Tower 1, 2, or 3. Otherwise, you&#39;ll have to walk five minutes, dragging your luggage through the lobby, to the other side. As you make your way through, you&#39;ll be surprised by the sheer volume of people coming and going: gamblers, shoppers, tourists, and guests mingling in the hotel lobby, the noise is so loud it&#39;s a headache. When your turn finally arrives, you&#39;ll find that the average check-in time per desk is ten minutes, and some of the chatterboxes love chatting with guests. Just wait. 2. The room. Although I knew there was no bathtub before arriving, I still thought a hotel costing over 4,000 yuan a night was reasonable considering the other amenities and location. But I was surprised—there was no shower gel or shampoo, and I had to call to get them. The disposable slippers looked like those in a budget hotel in China. The bathroom had no dry/wet separation, so if one person went to the toilet, the whole family had to wait patiently outside. The toothbrush was even more appalling, costing no more than a few yuan, even worse than a budget hotel. It&#39;s Sands after all, so why should it be so awful? 3. The so-called internet-famous infinity pool. Remember not to go during the day, or you won&#39;t be able to get a single bed. You&#39;ll be searching like a waiter delivering drinks, searching everywhere. After half an hour, I couldn&#39;t find one, so I went back and didn&#39;t swim anymore. It&#39;s a little better after 8 PM. 4. Check-out. I called Ctrip and myself, and even a minute later, I couldn&#39;t check out. Bottom line: Never come back. For this price, isn&#39;t staying at the InterContinental or Kempinski better? Many hotels in Singapore have infinity pools. Some say the &quot;IQ tax&quot; is a misconception for the poor, but is it really worth wasting money on something you don&#39;t like? This kind of hotel should not be recommended in a prime location. Those who want to give money will naturally show it on their social circle. A better experience is not worth going here. For years I&#39;ve written reviews that are almost always positive and short, but today for the first time I&#39;m going to post negative + long one. 1. check in.

The only thing is that the old room is really old. Not only is it priced at over 6,000, but the bedding, bathrobes, and toiletries are completely different from the newly renovated ones. Are you sure it&#39;s a hotel? It&#39;s so overpriced for something like this, it&#39;s a steal. The only thing is that the pool, the shopping mall downstairs, and ****** are really convenient. They should renovate it quickly. It&#39;s okay to book a newly renovated one for over 6,000. You absolutely must book a newly renovated one! The breakfast was good and plentiful. The front desk service was terrible, extremely slow, and inefficient. However, the concierge service was quite good. The lobby was crowded, and the concierge staff would go around asking guests with their luggage if they needed help. On check-out day, Edgardo met us in the lobby as we loaded our luggage onto a luggage cart. He asked if we were checking in or out, and even called a taxi for us. Seeing how many people we were, he told me to just call a large one. He even loaded all our luggage into the car. It felt like you could still enjoy service in the crowded Sands."

從老到小住了一圈（萊佛士、嘉佩樂）還是最喜歡金沙。感覺太太太太讚了。當然房間不算大，但真的衹有睡覺才在房間裏，其他時候都太太太太太讚了！！
無邊泳池yyds！早餐廳樓頂的視野絕絕子，樓下的好吃種類多（建議還是吃樓下的哈哈）。
去濱海灣花園太方便（濱海灣花園每次玩完回去打車都不方便，體驗了兩次都是打不到車，大排隊，所以還是住金沙步行最方便）。圖上就是在金沙坐電梯上空中花園，走到濱海灣的那個路，真的建議走這條，美很多。

房間夜景很好，能直接看到魚獅尾，入住時給免費升級了城市夜景房（後來賊後悔，想要濱海灣花園景色，但是房間全滿了換不了）

提醒：會中文的不多，很多印度服務員。不過還是可以溝通的，求助時也能找到中文的。",2025-09-08 22:59:23,zh-TW,"Three days wasn&#39;t enough, so I&#39;ll be back next time. After staying at a variety of hotels, from the oldest to the youngest (Raffles, Capella), I still love the Sands the most. It&#39;s absolutely amazing. Sure, the room isn&#39;t huge, but I only use it when I sleep. Otherwise, it&#39;s absolutely amazing! The infinity pool is amazing! The view from the rooftop breakfast restaurant is incredible, and there&#39;s a wide variety of delicious food downstairs (I recommend eating downstairs, haha). It&#39;s so convenient to Gardens by the Bay (it&#39;s always hard to get a taxi back after visiting the Gardens by the Bay. I tried it twice and couldn&#39;t get one, there were huge lines, so it&#39;s more convenient to walk from the Sands). The picture shows the path from the Sands elevator up to the SkyPark and then to Marina Bay. I highly recommend taking this route; it&#39;s so much more beautiful. The night view from the room is amazing, with a direct view of the Merlion&#39;s Tail. We were given a free upgrade to a City Night View room upon check-in (which I later regretted; I wanted a Gardens by the Bay view, but they were all booked up and couldn&#39;t change). A word of caution: there aren&#39;t many Chinese-speaking staff, and many of the staff are Indian. However, it&#39;s still possible to communicate, and you can find Chinese speakers when you need help."

下午3點入住，可能因為我們預訂的房型沒有出來空房，等了有10多分鐘後，前台小姐姐給主動升級了豪華大套房，衹比頂層低了兩層。

這個房型面朝大海，有兩個房間，一個大客廳，一個睡房，都有陽台，雖然陽台外面很穿窄，但站一個上去，吹吹海風，欣賞一下一覽無垠的大海還是相當愜意的。
衞生間也非常大，還有專門的穿衣間。

下午17點左右，還有專門的服務員，説是提供夜床服務，給過來專門拉窗簾和鋪床，這大概是頂級酒店的待遇。

冰箱裏有免費的堅果零食，還有水果汁，免費的瓶裝水，這個瓶裝水不知道什麼牌子，入口很好喝，沒有了還可以繼續要，仍給免費提供。
也有各種咖啡和茶點。

無邊泳池非常好，，我們入住這天天氣晴朗，安頓好了正值傍晚時分，所以趴在泳池邊上，記錄了整個落日的全過程。
早上，在房間就可以欣賞到海上的日出，新加坡臨近赤道，晝夜平分，7點多太陽才出來，不用起很早就可以在房間看到海上的日出。
但如果想要景觀更遼闊一些，還是要上到57樓的頂樓去看日出，我是在房間看了一會，又跑到頂樓去看了，這邊的泳池早上6點就開放了，我上去時已經有不少人在水裡泡着欣賞早上的美景了。

相比下來，我還是更喜歡早上海上日出的景像，三三兩兩的漁船擱置在平靜的海面上，金色澄澈的陽光灑滿整個海平面，火紅的太陽在海平面冉冉升起，非常美麗。

金沙酒店雖然是貴了一些，但其本身就是一大景點，還是值得揮霍一晚。",2025-09-08 23:02:07,zh-TW,"I was very satisfied with my stay. We checked in at 3 PM. Perhaps because our reserved room type wasn&#39;t available, after waiting for over 10 minutes, the receptionist proactively upgraded us to a deluxe suite, just two floors below the top floor. This ocean-facing room has two rooms: a large living room and a bedroom, both with balconies. Although narrow, it was quite pleasant to stand on one, enjoy the sea breeze, and admire the endless ocean views. The bathroom was also very large, and there was a dedicated dressing room. Around 5 PM, a dedicated attendant arrived to offer turndown service, drawing the curtains and making the bed—perfect amenities expected of a top-tier hotel. The refrigerator contained complimentary nuts, fruit juice, and free bottled water. I don&#39;t know the brand, but it was delicious. If it ran out, we could always request more, and they would provide it. There was also a variety of coffee and tea options. The infinity pool was fantastic. The weather was beautiful the day we checked in, and after settling in, it was dusk, so I spent the evening by the poolside, capturing the entire sunset. In the morning, you can enjoy the sunrise over the sea from your room. Singapore is near the equator, so the sun doesn&#39;t rise until after 7 a.m., so you can watch it from your room without getting up too early. However, for a more expansive view, you&#39;ll want to go up to the 57th floor rooftop. I watched it from my room for a while, then went up to the rooftop. The swimming pool opens at 6 a.m., and when I got there, quite a few people were already enjoying the morning view. I preferred the sunrise over the sea in the morning. Fishing boats were stranded on the calm sea, the golden sunlight bathed the horizon, and the fiery red sun rose slowly above the water. It was truly beautiful. While the Marina Bay Sands is a bit pricey, it&#39;s a major attraction in itself and well worth the splurge for a night."

I booked a waterfront view, but they insisted on a city view, and I wasn&#39;t given a room until after 5:00. However, there were so many people checking in, so forget it. The infinity pool on the 57th floor is a whopping 150 meters long, and most people were taking photos. I was the only one swimming. On the other side, you can see the Strait of Malacca, which is nice for soaking up the sun. However, it was so crowded, like a tourist attraction, that I don&#39;t think it&#39;s suitable for families. The hotel is right downstairs from the MRT, just two or three stops from Chinatown. I&#39;d like to try Tiantian Hainan Chicken, so I recommend taking the MAXWELL Line to the station. Tiantian Hainan Chicken is on the left as soon as you exit.

Много питьевой воды и капсульного кофе на любой вкус в большом количестве. Все в красивых пакетиках, в ванной мне не описать все просто поживите там минимум две ночи, потому что за одну ночь вы не успеете насладиться всем, что там есть!

Everything in the room was thoughtfully designed down to the last detail: they even gave us a children&#39;s shower set and super soft slippers for our little one.
