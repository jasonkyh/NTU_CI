The room facilities are outdated and aging, just like a five-star hotel in the 1990s. There is no bathtub, and the service is not felt at all. It takes a long time to order food from the room. The swimming pool is really bad The building is very tall and the scenery outside the window is not bad. It&#39;s a hotel that doesn&#39;t live up to its name. I can only say that it feels like a hotel that is run arrogantly because it is a landmark."

I called to confirm the details on last weekend before the actual booking day on this Monday. Then Klook staff informed me that the price I pay was for 1 night stay, even though every step for the purchase showed it's a 2 night stay  including the voucher itself. The screenshots are upload in this post. \n\nAfter spent a lot of effort, I managed to get a call from Klook 5 days ago (11th Sep) and said they will fix the description in the app and either honer the deal or refund me. They claim there will be a email send to me within 48 hours which is not ture. \n\nA few things make me feel this is too much for a online platform to treat their customer this way. \n1) No conclusion was given to me after 6 days, and it already passed the actual booking day. \n2) They can fix their app in 1 day, but cloud not send an email to me with conclusion. \n3) They like to blame the customer before they validate from their end. \n\nHope everyone don't get the same treatment from Klook as me."

Pool timing is hard to book and we took the midnight slot. But there were fewer people so you literally have the whole pool to yourself. Gym booking will put you in a queue and you will be notified on mobile to be at the gym within 15mins. Enjoyed the morning and evening walks around Marina Bay and Gardens by the Bay. Celebrated birthday and MBS gave a generous sized chocolate cake."

Can get quite crowded up there as well despite limited slots so go up early if you want to secure good poolside seats. \n\nBreakfast and check-in/ out services by staff were quite efficient as fuss-free.\n\nFood options around were expensive but good if you want to indulge (Gordon’s restaurant was great). \n\nWent to the ArtScience museum and walked out to the Esplanade, Citylink Mall and Suntec City when we decided to further explore."
