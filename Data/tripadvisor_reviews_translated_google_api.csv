Marek K,Sep 17,After a rough start they won us over like no other hotel. What memories we created there.,"We had been looking forward to our stay at Marina Bay Sands for a very long time and our expectations were set extremely high. Unfortunately not everything went smoothly from the very beginning. I would not hesitate to call our initial experience a real disaster to the extent that my first impression and evaluation were completely opposite. I was very disappointed and, to be honest, upset.

However mistakes can happen in any hotel or company and the most important thing is how the property responds when issues arise. In this case the reaction was absolutely exemplary. Thanks to the incredible care of Mr. Viktor M. and his team with special mention to Shataz H. and her team, room stylist Htet P., the airport transfer driver and the assistant at the airport (my sincere apologies for not remembering all the names) they managed to turn an unpleasant situation into an unforgettable experience and a memory of a lifetime. For this I will be grateful until the end of my life not only for how they faced the problems head on but also for everything they did for us. I feel humbled, grateful and happy that everything eventually turned out more than excellent, although at the same time sad that our twelve day stay in Singapore has already come to an end.

Next time during our fourth visit we were originally planning only a stopover and as I am professionally from the travel industry we wanted to explore more of the iconic hotels Singapore has to offer. However after what Marina Bay Sands has provided us this time I am now seriously considering remaining loyal to Marina Bay Sands and its team for all our future stays in Singapore.

Thank you for everything and I very much look forward to any future reunion. I wish the entire team all the best and many more satisfied guests like my wife and me.

Now a few words about the rooms, restaurants, pool and other attractions that Marina Bay Sands operates around the hotel. The rooms are modern, luxurious and above all clean. The room stylists are very well trained, they pay attention to the smallest details and are able to notice tiny things that would never cross my mind. From the restaurants we had the chance to try the newly renovated Lavo which was one hundred percent, Wakuda one hundred percent, Spago one hundred percent and Rise ninety percent only because of occasional chaos during breakfast service. The infinity pool does not really need any introduction and there is nothing to add that has not already been said a million times. For us it is one hundred percent. The attractions in the area such as the ArtScience Museum, The Shoppes, the casino and others were all one hundred percent. The hotel services that we had the chance to try were also one hundred percent. The location is unbeatable. For most tourists Marina Bay Sands is the centerpiece of their exploration of Singapore. The price may seem high at first glance especially when compared with competitors but based on our own experience I must say it is more than reasonable. The value for money is in my opinion very advantageous. Communication is the category that is hardest for me to evaluate because in the beginning it did not work well on several levels. However once the problems started to be addressed it was on such a level that it became a great inspiration for me. Especially thanks to the already mentioned Viktor M. and Shataz H.

TRAVELLER WORLD,Sep 15,Amazing building,"The Marina Bay Sands is probably the most iconic and spectacular building in Singapore. Its unique architecture, made up of three towers linked at the top by a huge boat-shaped platform, makes it a symbol of the city and one of the most recognizable images in the world.

As soon as you enter, the main hall impresses with its dimensions. It is a huge, elegant and modern space, full of restaurants of all kinds, cafes and luxury shops. The Mood is vibrant and cosmopolitan, with visitors from all over the world coming both to stay and simply to see the place.

Restaurants and bars with unparalleled panoramic views of Singapore can be found on the upper floors. From there you can see the bay, the skyscrapers of the financial center and nearby attractions such as the Gardens by the Bay or the Cloud Forest. Many visitors recommend taking to the SkyPark Observation Deck to enjoy the sunset or the illuminated city at night.

Another big attraction is the rooftop infinity pool, exclusive to hotel guests. It is one of the most famous swimming pools in the world as it gives the feeling of being literally swimming over the Singapore skyline. Although not everyone can access it, just seeing it in photos or from outside the building is already impressive.

Marina Bay Sands is not just a hotel: it is a complete leisure complex. Inside is a large luxury shopping mall with international boutiques, a world-class casino, an art and science museum with very interesting exhibitions and even a theater with shows.

Stevexyz2003,Sep 10,An absolute dream this world-class hotel,"Recommendation for Marina Bay Sands

A stay at Marina Bay Sands is simply a dream – an absolute top class hotel!

As soon as you enter, you will be impressed by the stylish elegance and high-quality, beautiful furnishings of the rooms. Everything is thought through to the smallest detail and exudes luxury and comfort.

I would particularly like to highlight the outstanding Service: super friendly, attentive, warm and always striving to fulfill every wish of the guests – I have hardly experienced anything like this worldwide.

The breakfast buffet is the most varied and best I have ever enjoyed – a true culinary journey around the globe.

A stay at Marina Bay Sands is simply a dream – an absolute top class hotel!

As soon as you enter, you will be impressed by the stylish elegance and high-quality, beautiful furnishings of the rooms. Everything is thought through to the smallest detail and exudes luxury and comfort.

I would particularly like to highlight the outstanding Service: super friendly, attentive, warm and always striving to fulfill every wish of the guests – I have hardly experienced anything like this worldwide.

The breakfast buffet is the most varied and best I have ever enjoyed – a true culinary journey around the globe.

Rachelle W,Sep 10,Amazing yoga class,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
I had such an incredible experience doing yoga at Marina Bay Sands! 🧘‍♀️✨ Practicing with the stunning view of the Singapore skyline and infinity pool was absolutely unforgettable. The instructor was calming, professional, and really helped guide us through a flow that was both grounding and energizing. The atmosphere was peaceful yet uplifting — the perfect balance for body and mind.

Max_66MRoma,Sep 9,Infinity pool on the 57th floor and impeccable Service: Marina Bay Sands captivates you,"We stayed three days in Singapore and decided to spend the last night at Marina Bay Sands: the experience was truly unique. In fact, this hotel is one of Singapore's iconic attractions, a must for those visiting the city.
A plus not to be underestimated: access to the Observation Deck is free for hotel guests, offering spectacular views of the city.

I was immediately impressed by the kindness and professionalism of the staff at the entrance, who promptly handled the luggage with great care. The hotel is very large, so check-in procedures can take a while, but again the staff was extremely helpful and courteous. We were offered a room upgrade to a higher floor with spectacular views of the park and, in part, the city. The only condition was to wait about 45 minutes, which we spent pleasantly in the infinity pool area, sipping a welcome cocktail offered by the hotel.

The room on the 28th floor was really superb: about 50 square meters, with a large terrace, home automation system to manage curtains, lights and more, a spacious bathroom with separate bath and shower, Japanese toilet, and a high quality amenities kit.
In particular, I appreciated:

Sheets of Frette
Bathrobes and soft towels
Very comfortable slippers
Wide range of bathroom products
Well stocked minibar
Tea and coffee making facilities
Station with liquor and snacks
Large television set
Comfortable king size bed
Bright and spacious room
Large safe
Well-organized spaces for suitcases and clothes
Dyson hair dryer
The highlight of the hotel is undoubtedly the infinity pool on the 57th floor, which connects the three towers of the building. According to some rankings, it is among the top three infinity pools in the world. The view is breathtaking, and access is reserved exclusively for hotel guests. The area is furnished with lush plants, sun loungers, towels available, and impeccable Service that allows you to order snacks and drinks directly from the sun lounger.
Near the pool there are also panoramic hot tubs, ideal for relaxing while admiring the Singapore skyline in an exclusive atmosphere.

There are three main restaurants: Spago, Ce La Vie and Spago Lounge. We had dinner at Spago and were very satisfied.

The only point that can be improved: breakfast. You can do it in the area adjacent to the infinity pool, chosen by almost all guests. However, I had to do almost an hour in a row, and the breakfast is not buffet style but à la carte, with quite long waiting times. If I had known, I would have opted for the restaurant near the lobby.

In conclusion, the experience was excellent. I chose this hotel because of the infinity pool, and I can say that it was absolutely worth it. The price is high, but justified by the overall quality of the stay.

First, the room was immaculate and very thoughtful. The dual sinks were separated so my wife and I have our own space. It is far easier on the plumbing to have dual sinks next to each other. The bed sheets were freshly prepared. We wash and dry our sheets and we know the effort it took to prepare the bed. We had a wonderful sleep.

The staff was always thinking of how to improve their services. When we ordered two candies, the quick service heard we were checking out and offered luggage service. In addition they delivered the candies in ten minutes because they heard we were going to the airport. Super proactive.

sandromac,Sep 7,Iconic experience,"We stayed at this iconic hotel for one night only, but it was really worth it, if you are planning a trip to Singapore you must definitely try it!

It was a fantastic experience, the hospitality was amazing as was your kindness. We had a beautiful room (Sands Premier King Gardens By The Bay View) overlooking the spectacular Gardens by the Bay! We could see comfortably seated on the terrace the light shows of the Garden by the Bay, really beautiful.

The room was really luxurious, super equipped, comfortable and the view from the balcony was breathtaking! Frette sheets, bathrobes and soft towels, comfortable slippers, lots of bathroom products, minibar, tea and coffee making facilities, liquor station, snacks, huge TV, comfortable king size bed, bright and spacious room, bathtub and shower, super technological toilet, large safe, spaces for luggage and clothes, Dyson hairdryer...
The staff was super welcoming, friendly and helpful: really great!!! We had a little problem with the TV, but a technician arrived in 5 minutes to repair it.
We told the reception that it was my husband's birthday and that we would appreciate an early check-in and a great view from our room, all requests were met! You also gave us a delicious chocolate cake for her birthday.

The infinity pool is truly unique!!! It enjoys a panoramic view of the whole city. It is divided into 3 areas, one of which is adults only, there is a bar, many sunbeds and rooms to change, in addition to the staff who takes care of security and assistance in the pool.

Access to the swimming pool is reserved for hotel guests, free access to the platform with panoramic views is also provided (for outdoors there is paid access).

Thank you very much, we hope to return to your hotel soon, maybe for a few more nights...

AlexScott,Sep 3,Great service and luxury hotel,"I had been dreaming of my honeymoon for so long, and Marina Bay Sands was always at the top of my list of places in Asia to celebrate this special time. We arrived in the evening on 23 Aug 25 and stayed at Tower 3 in a Sands Premier City View room. From the moment we stepped in, we were overwhelmed with beautiful flowers at the Front Office, setting such a warm and romantic atmosphere.

Ressylene C,Sep 1,Premium Services from MBS,"We had a wonderful time at Marina Bay Sands. We booked three rooms (two Garden View Standard Rooms and one Garden View Suite) for our family. The rooms were spacious, comfortable, and elegant. Our elderly family members and children particularly enjoyed the garden view from the balcony, especially the nightly light shows. We also had a great time at the SkyPark observation deck and the rooftop infinity pool. Our stay included a breakfast buffet, afternoon tea, and aperitifs, all of which we thoroughly enjoyed.

The staff at Marina Bay Sands provided excellent service. Upon our arrival, we were greeted by the bellhops, Jan and Ian, who helped us with our luggage. Michelle Nguyen from the front desk checked us in smoothly and made sure to accommodate our need for quick rooming due to our little children. We were also welcomed by Eunice Marasigan from MBS Premium Services in our rooms. She was enthusiastic about showing us how to make the most of our stay at MBS. Eunice was incredibly thoughtful and ensured our stay was both memorable and pleasant. When she learned that it was a birthday getaway for me and my family, she surprised us with birthday cakes delivered to our rooms throughout our stay. On our last day, champagne and sweets were delivered to all our rooms as a special touch. It was such a kind and thoughtful gesture.

Our room was kept clean and comfortable throughout our stay by Xiao Xin, our room stylist. We also had DJ, King, and Edgardo from guest services, all of whom were friendly, accommodating, and always ready to assist.

As soon as we arrived, Eunice (Premium Services) gave us the warmest and most attentive welcome, showing us in detail the impressive room we had been given. Her service was exquisite and incredibly pleasant. She even gifted us with a song she composed :-).

The infinity pool is simply stunning. It offers unbeatable views of Singapore at any time of day; but sunset is undoubtedly the
best time to enjoy these

As for the food, the brunch buffet is the best we've ever seen. Such an impressive variety of top-quality dishes, it's a shame we couldn't eat more :-)

nactis11_yahoo,Aug 2025,Among my favorite hotels!,"Definitely in the first places of the hotels where I have been and you come back with your eyes closed! I booked directly with the hotel asking for a room on the upper floors overlooking Supertree Grove: just fantastic. Every night from the balcony I could enjoy the light and music show... incredible and really exciting.

The hotel is huge and I try to briefly summarize the pros and cons:

Against:

I had booked a room with a balcony, but initially I was given one with no outside seating and a very narrow balcony. I had to wait one night to get the one with sofa and coffee table, so I recommend specifying it clearly in the request.

I arrived very early in the morning and could only have the room at the exact time of check-in (certainly because of the high turnout)

Superb breakfast, but with queues practically always. In any case, never more than 10/15 minutes.

Pros:

The spectacular infinity pool, where I could relax while waiting for the room.

Free admission to the observatory, reserved for guests, is a must-see plus.

The rooms: modern, ultra-technological and spotless. I loved the little details, like the neat phone/laptop cables with custom cable ties.

Presence of a bar corner in all rooms (not included, shame because the cost of the room is quite important).

In summary: this was one of the most beautiful hotels I have ever stayed at.

Our Premium Room was incredible. The coffee machine even has a leather outfit on it! The Premium Services team surprised us with beautiful flowers and champagne for arrival, and personalised service every step of the way.

The bedroom was very large, bigger than the average entire accommodation in most resorts. The bed was like being cuddled by a cloud and the sleep was superb.

Ordering room service through our TV was fascinating, and we were completely satisfied by the quality of the food.

Working with Robby and getting a thorough understanding of the range of services and facilities, in particular the meeting rooms for our bespoke consultancy services was very important.

We will be returning for our growing business activities with regional clients, and continuing our plans for the regional headquarters in Singapore, as it is one of the best locations globally.

Jessy s,Aug 2025,"Amazing trip, special review for Mark from Guest Services.","We had an amazing trip overall! Beautiful hotel, lives up to all of the glowing reviews! Great food and service but I want to specifically highlight Mark from Premium Services concierge. He was instrumental in setting up a surprise for my wife's birthday including balloons, champagne and a bouquet of flowers (he threw that in on his own!). He communicated often with me regarding birthday plans but also went the extra mile in coordinating dinner reservations as well. One time, he even physically walked to the restaurant (which wasn't directly on MBS premises) to confirm what the seating looked like at a particular time of evening (sometimes the restaurant officially was listed as completely reserved but still had some tables open). The entire concierge services team was fantastic but his efforts warrant a separate highlight.

Matelo,Aug 2025,A Stay Saved by Exceptional Customer Service,"Our recent stay at Marina Bay Sands started very badly: we arrived the day after the National Day, we encountered several inconveniences that could have spoiled our 5-star experience!

You still have to keep in mind or know that the hotel has more than 1700 rooms! Which basically means not far from 3,500 customers! You can imagine breakfast and the world in the common areas, considering the integration into a large shopping center. An almost cultural experience...

But the management response has been exemplary: proactive, responsive and remarkably effective. Their quick and personalized intervention completely changed the course of our stay, turning a difficult departure into a pleasant moment for the whole family.

For Western travellers, it may be a good idea to contact management in advance in order to benefit from individualised care – for example, transfer from the airport and personalised Welcoming – to avoid being drowned in the influx of arrivals and to ensure a stay perfectly aligned with the usual expectations of this clientele.

I was very embarrassed because we came from direct travel and had a ton of luggage and were dressed like we just came from the beach. We were immediately greeted though so warmly I quickly forgot. Everything is extremely organized and efficient with everybody having a defined role, but really going out of their way to make the experience unforgettably a cut above the rest. I never got to directly think many of the people that touched us when we were there. They were kind to us without any return gratitude.

Aellex pulled me out of line for VIP check-in, as I told him I was so embarrassed as to how we were dressed, and he said you just look like a VIP so I’m bringing you back here. Gwen took my daughter to get a complimentary drink, and Anna helped us check-in and relayed a kind story about her relationship with her mom and herself, as she noticed I was travelling alone with my daughter. I won’t ever forget Anna and hope to say thank you again for the relatable story and making our stay the best ever in my life.

Extraordinary customer service, the beautiful room (thank you to Danny, Yan, and Yvan, thank you for every detail and the tour of how the smart switches worked in our room), and the food… we had breakfast at the pool, which was a tremendous opportunity because of the short timeframe we had… And we had a beautiful 50th birthday dinner at Ce La Vi.

Once we arrived, Robby greeted us at the front of the hotel and took us straight to our room for an in room check in. The bell service team were also extremely prompt with bringing our luggage to the room and were very friendly. Not only did Robby give us a personal tour of our suite (complimentary upgrade) but also surprised our family with free buffet breakfast, afternoon tea and aperitif hour each day of our stay. He also surprised our family with free tickets to a balloon exhibition that was happening at the Expo centre. He was very kind, welcoming and knowledgeable about Marina Bay Sands and all the services the hotel had to offer. He also helped us organise dinner reservations and organised a birthday cake and champagne in our room upon our arrival.

He was in constant communication with our driver and immediately notified him when we were ready for our pick up. Our driver was friendly and talkative and had a lot of knowledge on Singapore. Once we arrived, Robby greeted us at the front of the hotel and took us straight to our room for an in room check in. The bell service team were also extremely prompt with bringing our luggage to the room and were very friendly. Not only did Robby give us a personal tour of our suite (complimentary upgrade) but also surprised our family with free buffet breakfast, afternoon tea and aperitif hour each day of our stay. He also surprised our family with free tickets to a balloon exhibition that was happening at the Expo centre. He was very kind, welcoming and knowledgeable about Marina Bay Sands and all the services the hotel had to offer. He also helped us organise dinner reservations and organised a birthday cake and champagne in our room upon our arrival.

Our entire experience at Marina Bay Sands and interaction with every staff member was memorable, exceptional and exceeded our expectations. We are so very grateful for the experience we had and the attention to detail shown. We will 100% be back and would recommend anyone to stay at Marina Bay Sands."

Valinda JT,Aug 2025,Horrifying Experience at Marina Bay Sands – Zero Care After a Life-Threatening Lift Accident,"My stay at Marina Bay Sands turned into a nightmare due to a terrifying lift malfunction in Tower 2. While using the Paiza lift to the 55th floor, the lift suddenly plummeted in a free-fall between the 42nd and 55th floors. My heart was pounding, and I barely had time to grab the railing while mashing the emergency button and every floor below. The lift finally jerked to a stop at the 47th floor, where I stumbled out, visibly shaken. Another guest sitting outside heard the loud bangs from the lift and asked if I was okay—even he was alarmed.

A staff member escorted me upstairs, where Senior Service Manager Ella Barrientos spoke to me. When I said I needed urgent medical help, she downplayed the incident and told me to wait 1-3 hours for a the hotel to get a doctor from raffles hospital to come over. When I demanded an ambulance, she
discouraged it, pushing their MBS limo service instead—another 30-minute delay. It was clear they didn’t want an ambulance report documenting the incident.

Unacceptable Failures:
1. No Emergency Priority – They denied me immediate medical care, downplaying a life-threatening malfunction.
2. No Follow-Up or Support – Not a single staff member came to the hospital to check on me. No calls, no updates— total abandonment.
3. Zero Accountability – The staff acted like this was a minor inconvenience, not a safety failure that could have killed me.

This was not just an accident—it was gross negligence. Marina Bay Sands failed at every level: emergency response, guest care, and basic human decency. Never again. If you value your safety and well-being, avoid this hotel at all costs.

Louis-Antoine,Aug 2025,Incroyable,"To celebrate my 40th birthday and my daughter’s 18th birthday, I decided to treat myself to a night at this hotel. Although the price is quite high (CDN$1,225), I loved my experience.

As soon as we arrived by taxi, the staff immediately took care of us. I was supposed to have a room overlooking the gardens, but it wasn’t ready yet. So I was offered a room with city views at no extra cost. Just... wow!

When I booked directly on the hotel website, I mentioned that I was paying myself this luxury to celebrate my daughter’s 18th birthday and 40th birthday. After a first swim, we returned to the room, and a party cake had been dropped off for my daughter. What a beautiful attention!

The room was exceptionally clean. The bathroom, perfect. We could have made cocktails so well thought out.

The pool? It is simply breathtaking!

The breakfast buffet (included) was exquisite. I also tried the evening buffet. Personally, I preferred the morning meal, but my daughter preferred dinner. As a result, we were both satisfied.

Certainly, if I ever return to Singapore, I want to come back here — maybe even for more than one night.

K8SAS,Jul 2025,"Come for the room, lower your expectations for everything else","For the price, very average. I’ve stayed at quite a few luxury resorts and hotels. The service and friendliness were below average for the cost and reputation of the hotel. The front desk was barely warm, welcoming, or friendly. Very transactional… I get it, you want our money. There is literally nowhere to sit in the lobby area, just a few hard benches.

The best part of the stay was the room. The amenities were nice (Nespresso machine, Dyson hair dryer, chocolates, TWG tea), the view of the Gardens, and overall comfort was great. Our room attendant was phenomenal, the most friendly and attentive part of the stay. The attention detail was superb. Everything from wrapping up our cords, to placing bookmarks in our books, to noting which teas, chocolates and coffee pods we liked and stocking with extra…. Soo good! I only wish the balcony had a sitting area? Even a stool would be nice.

The pool area was also quite good. Views couldn’t be beat and the chairs were comfy. Towels and water were plentiful. Again the prices were crazy. $15 for a small bottled beer, $25 for a cocktail that was 4 sips. For that price I would expect a Texas Roadhouse sized goblet.

Enormous breakfast buffet, very very fine. ""You need gluten free? Here, come speak with the chef. If we don't already have it he will make it for you."" Could not fault their helpful attitude.

And of course there's that rooftop infinity pool. Which, if anything, is better than the photos make it seem. So chilled to lie by the pool and have drinks and food magically appear.

FlyingDutchman999,Jul 2025,Good place to relax by the Gardens,"When we entered the lobby, one of our group remarked, “This feels like an airport.” The check-in queue echoed the experience you might have at Changi Airport — systematic, swiftish , but not particularly personal. What made all the difference were Simon and Ivy. Their thoughtful professionalism and warm demeanor turned a routine process into a genuinely welcoming start to our stay. Huge thanks to them.

Our rooms were located on the sixth floor of Tower 3, facing Gardens by the Bay. They were fresh, impeccably appointed, and the view toward the gardens left little to be desired. That said, the road-facing side meant some noise filtered in — improved glazing could help future guests sleep a little more soundly.

The 57th floor houses the famous infinity pool — a marvel of modern architecture and an unforgettable place to unwind. The water was refreshingly cool, the sun generously warm, and the pool bar staff kept service moving with a smile. The poolside menu could use a bit of expansion, but that’s just being particular.

Also on the 57th are Spago and C‘est la vie, both boasting the same panoramic views you get from the pool. We had breakfast at Spago Lounge one morning and tried the buffet on the first floor the next. Spago was fine — pleasant but unremarkable. The buffet was chaotic. It felt less like breakfast and more like watching herds of buffalo descend on the food stations. There’s plenty of choice, yes, but for a calmer experience, I’d head down to the mall level for artisanal bakeries and quieter cafés.

The overall experience at Marina Bay Sands remains iconic. Would I return?

Time2SeeItAll,Jul 2025,Let's not get too excited.,"I am a confirmed guest of MBS from 8th July to 11th July, 2025, can provide evidence of my tenancy if required. So check-in is hands down the worst that I have experienced in 25 years of travelling and over 50 countries visited. There were hidden costs - yes hidden until check-in - and a ""delay"" of a security deposit of 1 month!!!! announced at check-in! So they take my deposit and security bond IMMEDIATELY, but refund takes 1 month!!! WTF?
Okay, let's continue. I was given the the hard sell on all ""features"" and ""functions"" of the MBS. Yep, knew all that before I got there because I have the internet!!! Christ, check-in took 20 minutes because of this sales pitch! I'm not exaggerating, 20 minutes of an up-sell and myself and my daughters were dying for oxygen!!!
Please, pull back on the up sell and just let people check in! Your guests generally have travelled for a long time to be at your check-in, just let them get to their room!

So the facilities are excellent, as you'd expect. Please be aware, like Las Vegas, big hotels = long walking time to anything. The key feature to this hotel is the pool. Just 100% superb, but outside that, you're going to pay the price. I stayed at the MBS for 3 nights, then the Fullerton Hotel for 4 and the Fullerton kills this hotel for value, customer service and quality. Having stayed at the MBS, I will never stay there again, not even if you paid me.

There's many people who stay one night to access the pool and then rave about 5* quality and how great they are being able to afford such luxury. Spare me.

The change between Bali and Singapore and Ritz Carlton Ubud to Marina Bay Sands is immediate. Singapore is truly a beating city life place.

marella1966,Jul 2025,It's not worth it.,"We arrived on a plane from Vietnam that changed schedules twice and so we arrived late. They had not received the payment of the room by the agency made well in advance (I do not know how you can receive money and not combine it with the payment of something) and did not do any research but just another charge on my credit card. No effort to search the agency's emails, nothing. Luckily my card was large because when you stay 20 days on the road you have a lot of expenses. at 11pm in a hotel like this with these costs no one gave you food, Room Service did not even answer the call, it was 11pm not 2am.
They arranged the transfer to the airport from the hotel departing at 6.30am and had told the agency that they would provide us with a box with breakfast: absolutely nothing. We were fasted from lunch the day before...... I would say scandalous.

Flying Kiwis,Jul 2025,An amazing family vacation at MBS,"Our family of 2 adults and 2 kids (4 & 10) have just returned from a wonderful 7 nights stay at Marina Bay Sand. The Marina Bay Sands team went over and above to ensure our stay was memorable and amazing. We were treated so kindly by all staff, and we can honestly say that it is our favourite hotel in Singapore. Marina Bay Sands is a destination in itself, and we feel very fortunate to have been able to experience this once in a lifetime destination.

From the time that we landed at Changi Airport, we were met by the competent Premium team at arrival to escort us to our waiting vehicle; then when we arrived at the hotel we were again meet by another Premium team member who escorted us straight to our suite for a hassle free in-room check in avoiding the hustle and bustle of the main foyer; and then on our day of departure, Victor Mai, the hotel Manager took the time to personally assist us with a stress free check out. All of this made travelling with kids so easy and stress free.

Our kids have some sensory challenges and special dietary needs which made breakfast at the Rise restaurant a particularly stressful time – once Victor was made aware of this, Victor went over and above to offered solutions for us to have a more peaceful and enjoyable breakfast time as a family. We really appreciate Victor’s understanding and kindness.

The hotel itself is a beautiful work of architecture and our room, a Family Suite on the 9th floor did not disappoint – we had a spacious balcony offering breathtaking views overlooking Gardens by the Bay, and best of all, we were able to watch the Super Tree Light Shows each night from there which was just a magical experience.

Our Family Suite was well designed with family in mind – so spacious and impeccably cleaned; and with all the amenities a small family would need, best of all we loved the washer/dryer which came in handy when travelling with small children and the microwave oven which we used many times for our fresh popcorn. Our kids adored having their very own room which had a bunk bed, bean bags, a huge TV, Nintendo Switch and kid-friendly amenities.

We would like to say a special thank you to the following wonderful people at MBS that has made our holiday a truly memorable one.

• Victor Mai (Manager) – thank you for your understanding and kindness around our children’s dietary needs, and for handling our departure with such care. It really means a lot to us.
• Sid (The Club Lounge) – thank you for your kindness and friendship, we really enjoyed getting to know you, you made our little family feel so at home each time we dined at the Club Lounge, we will miss you. Thank you for taking the time to personally check that the kids' meals were always prepared to their special dietary requirements.
• Jian Dang (Room Stylist) – thank you for your hard work in keeping our suite impeccably clean and well stocked and we appreciate your thoughtfulness in ensuring that the kids always had plenty of their favourite popcorn available.
• Angel (Premium Services) – thank you for your help with our special room service request when were out one day, your care in keeping us informed along the way which gave us peace of mind.
• The Pool Team – your friendliness and beautiful smiles always made us feel so welcomed each time we visited the infinity pool. Thank you for all your hard work in ensuring that we always have enough towels and refreshments and for keeping everyone safe.
• Raymond (Bellman) – thank you for helping us with our many pieces of luggage, your dedication and care is really appreciated.

We highly recommend the Marina Bay Sands especially if you are travelling with little kids as the Family Suite is awesome and has everything you would need; the location is perfect as there are so many dining options at the hotel and the shopping mall; lots of kid friendly attractions right at your door; taxis are always readily available without having to wait long; and the helpful, friendly MBS team are always on hand to help make your stay as stress free as possible.

Having stayed before the renovations, we didn’t expect much, but this visit completely changed our impression.

The suite was incredibly spacious with a gorgeous skyline view, karaoke room, fully equipped kitchen, and thoughtful in-room amenities (yes, even a pillow menu!). The attention to detail was superb.

The real highlight? Paiza Butler Service. Huge thanks to Ben and Vicky, who went above and beyond anticipating our needs—even noticing small things like when we needed a plastic bag or misplaced our key. Check-in and checkout were seamless.

Sky Residence, the exclusive lounge for Paiza guests, was another standout—amazing food all day with rotating menus. Special thanks to Mr. Sara and Ms. Joppy for their warmth and impeccable service. I may have gained 5 lbs in 2 days, but it was worth every bite.

Also shoutout to Laura and Sun at the infinity pool who added to the magic with their smiles and stunning photos.

blackmen,Jul 2025,Still unique on this earth. But be careful when booking a suite as part of the Sands Collection.,"Marina Bay Sands is indeed unique in the world. The three towers alone, the huge lobby, but also the pool in the 56th floor. Stock are more than breathtaking and leave nothing to be desired. A detour to Garden by the Bay or the harbour front is an absolute ""MUST"".
However, those guests who book a not exactly affordable suite as part of the ""Sands Collection"" are very disappointed. If regular guests have been used to enjoying the unique advantages of the ""Club 55"" in the course of the suite booking in recent years, they will be clearly disappointed. The ""Club 55"" is now forbidden to these suite bookers, only small pre-made snacks and 1 (!) Drink offered. And this offer can be found again in a location in the lobby, which at best exudes the charm of a bad train station pub.

Singvald,Jun 2025,An unforgettable night in the family suite at Marina Bay Sands,"We stayed one night in the family suite with two bedrooms and a separate children’s room – and it was MAGICAL! Right from the start we were picked up by luxury cars, which set the tone for the entire stay.

The room was huge, tastefully decorated and had everything we could want – and more. You could really tell that every detail was well thought out. The service was absolutely top class, with staff who were both professional and incredibly friendly.

Room service was on point – fast, smooth and with great food. The breakfast really gave everything you could want – an abundance of options, high quality and something for every taste.

The highlight was of course the infinity pool. Swimming up there with the iconic views of Singapore was an experience in itself. We ate club sandwiches and drank mocktails by the poolside – it felt like a scene from a movie.

jadewkm,Jun 2025,Mixed but o really good experience,"MBS Review
Top marks to welcome team (seamless transfer of luggage from taxi to luggage hold and then onto the rooms). Also very happy with room design ( thoughtfully laid out) though being on 3rd floor, balcony is noisy and showed road view rather than any garden by the bay view. For the price (over $32k), I would expect a quiet balcony with magnificent views.

Staff service is a mixed of helpful and indifferent. Not impressed by front desk and concierge, while Housekeeping is great, as are in-room dining, gift shop staff and limo service. Special mention of spa team -Yaneli , Lisa and Enita who provided excellent and friendly treatment. Also sky deck activities such as yoga and sound meditation were great though 2 classes were cancelled last minute due to lack of alternative arrangement during inclement weather.

Stay marred by drinking glass breaking in my 3 year old grandson's mouth in Rise restaurant during breakfast, staff were quick to act though.
In addition, the stay did not end on a happy note as my departure was held back by an unjustified demand for extra charge ( breakfast for the little ones).

Nevertheless overall experience is good.",4 of 5 bubbles,June 2025,Traveled with family,London,en,Mixed but o really good experience,en,"MBS Review

I would give Marina Bay Sands 10 stars if I could. Everything was just perfect. The team members at check in were lovely and made everything so easy. My luck with rooms is terrible, it doesn't matter what I pay I get the car park view. Not this time with no special request from us, we received a beautiful view of the gardens by the bay and could watch the light show every night. We even received a personal guide on arrival and departure that helped us settle in and get on our way which was amazing when travelling with a newborn and a 4 year old. The room has all the amenities you could ever need, drinks for the adults to snacks for the kiddies. So much thought has been put into all the little things you may need as a family on holiday, felt like we had more than we needed and all those things we forget they had. All the staff were fantastic and the food was incredible. Breakfast buffet had plenty to choose from and the dinner buffet was the best my wife and I have ever experienced.

portbarton,Jun 2025,Not happy at all,"So the lobby is nice, and swimming pool also, but if you are looking for a nice room, stay away. We had a room with two beds, and one ONE power outlet that was worn out and we had to use multiple adaptors (which we fortunately had) to get things to stay in without falling out, and plug in two chargers. We shared one bed, while our child use the other. Which meant even with our adaptors, the person on the outside cannot charge their phone.

But the worse part is the awful polyester bathrobes. I know resorts need to save money, but seriously, they can't afford to supply a cotton bathrobe to their guests when charging 1,300 dollars a night!

freeXspirit,Jun 2025,You can't really stay anywhere else when in Singapore!,"First visit to Singapore, and the Marina Bay Sands was the highlight of our trip! What an amazing property! Where do I start:

ROOMS - Spacious rooms with a large shower/tub, separate toilet with sink, good sized closet space with drawers and hanging shelves, good quality amenities. Excellent in every way.

SERVICE - Courteous and prompt, whenever we needed to call for anything! Concierge was also helpful in helping us navigate the city.

INFINITY POOL - Rooftop pool is one of the main highlights of this property! Go up early before the sun beats down on the roof - we got there at 6am every day when the pool opens, and it was heavenly right up until sunrise. Or you could go at sunset, but it gets really crowded then.

RESTAURANTS - We had breakfast included at their Spago, the rooftop restaurant, or the one at the Lobby level. The breakfast at Spago was a set menu - we chose the Laksa - outstanding!! The one in the lobby is a buffet, and that had a massive spread as well, but it was very very crowded! I guess folks prefer buffets to set menus?

FITNESS CENTER - Even though the fitness center is a bit of a hike to get to, coz it's in the Casino side of the building, it's a very well equipped gym and totally loves up to the hotel standards. Plenty of strength and cardio machines, all brand new and use the latest tech. Very impressive. If you prefer to run outdoors, there's a great 5k loop around the waterfront by the hotel - the concierge can help with map it (just keep in mind that it's hot and humid almost all the time!).

The shopping mall at the base of the hotel, as well as the walkway to Gardens by the Bay from the hotel, are both incredible. The mall has plenty of high end stores, and some excellent restaurants / coffee shops. You can never really get bored at this property!

Shap23,May 2025,Superb Accommodation in Beautiful Location,"I booked this hotel for its luxury, proximity to Sands Theatre, the shoppes and food court down below, and of course the infinity pool at the roof top. I stayed in a Double Queen Room with view of Garden by the Bay. The room was spacious. Automated curtains parted to reveal the superb view of Super Trees and Domes of Gardens by the Bay. Cleanliness and comfort in the room is top notch. Anemities are luxurious with toiletries from Jo Loves, hairdryer from Dyson and even the dustbin is leather. Pantry is very well equipped. Coffee maker comes with different coffee capsules. The Infinity Pool at 57th Floor is amazing and very Instagramable. All the staff that I encountered were helpful and very courteous.

The massage was an incredible experience—so relaxing that I actually fell asleep! I still felt the benefits afterward, completely at ease and tension-free. They also serve tea before and after the massage there’s tea and snacks for you, which added a really lovely touch to the whole experience.

Liv.C,May 2025,Mixed review due to room mix up,"With the sheer number of guests and rooms in this iconic hotel, it’s no surprise that check-in can be slow, and this visit was no exception. However, as a returning guest, I was very pleased to see that the check-out process has been streamlined—you simply drop your key card and any charges are billed directly to your credit card, making departure quick and hassle-free.

Unfortunately, there was a frustrating issue with our room allocation. Despite multiple confirmations prior, the hotel failed to provide the single king bed we had booked. The check-in staff offered us a downgraded room with blocked views—far from the full view with balcony we had reserved—if we wanted the correct bedding arrangement. This was disappointing and not what I would expect from a hotel of this calibre.

Michael G,May 2025,Fantastic Stay At Marina Bay Sands,"Our two-night stay at Marina Bay Sands exceeded our expections in every way. The room (suite) was fabulous and all of the generous little extras made us feel pampered and like all of our wants and needs had been anticipated and prepared for us in advance. The restaurant buffet experiences were equally fabulous, with a fantastic variety of dishes from many different cultures and an abundance of choices. We had planned to do some sightseeing in Singapore during our stay, but the resort itself had so much to offer in terms of great experiences that we never left the resort campus. We were expecially looking forward to the rooftop infinity pool and it was everything we were hoping for. We were expecting it to be crowded, but that was never the case. It was very relaxing and an exceedingly awesome experience! To cap it all off, on our final evening, after a relaxing sunset soak in the pool, we returned to our room to find a complementary tray of smoked salmon, caviar, and chocolate covered strawberries waiting for us, along with a sweet customized message from our personal concierge, Eunice, who had decorated our envelope with a drawing that clearly indicated she had been listening when we shared some of our current travel experience with her.

kou t,May 2025,Too bad at the end.,"The rooms and facilities were great.
No swimming pool, no restaurant.

I was unable to complete all the details I booked at the concierge.
① One-way transportation to and from the USS on 45-45
② One-way airport transfer service with family suite benefits at check-out
Until then, it was a great trip to be comfortable and to come again, but at the end everything was disgusting and I didn't even ask the front desk what to do, which was frustrating.
I want you to make sure that it gets across.

I was thrilled with the size, the facilities, the opulence, the very relaxing space. What's more, the children missed Miss April's kind and attentive guidance. I was also very happy with the presents for the children and the facilities in the children's room. Thank you.
The whole family was particularly excited about the infinity pool, and my son and others loved it and went there three times. Especially the night pool was amazing and the whole family really enjoyed it. I want to have more and more fun! It is a pool that I think.
The hospitality, facilities throughout the hotel and the day and night views from the hotel were definitely memories the whole family will remember for a lifetime and I definitely want to go to Bay Sands again.

It was my first time in Singapore, and she gave us great suggestions on where to go and what to check out. You can tell she really knows the place and loves helping guests.

Our room was beautiful, super clean, and had a great view—it definitely added to the whole experience. And of course, the infinity pool was a major highlight. It’s just as stunning in real life as it looks in the pictures. We spent a lot of time up there just relaxing and soaking in the view.

Natalie J,May 2025,It gets better every time we visit.,"This was our second stay at MBS as a friend was visiting and I wanted to treat her. I left the reservation too late and couldn't get a Paiza suite. However the wonderful lady at check in arranged an upgrade and we got a Seaview suite on the 52nd floor.

These suites are worth every single penny. Minute details were thought of when designing the suite. Wireless charging on almost every surface, a beautiful vanity to get ready at with a Dyson hairdryer. A room scent to use and take home. A variety of teas that will blow your mind. The shower is phenomenal and the bathroom also has a TV. On top of the two already in the suite! I could fault nothing!! And I'm picky!!!

We had breakfast at Spago on day 1 which was good. Dining options are not extensive and they will not cook to your needs. Food comes off a line and the chef won't take any changes. I asked for my bacon to be cooked longer as the fat was barely rendered for the table next to us and it was a no from the chef. I ordered an omelet.

Couldn't have breakfast at Rise the next day as the queue was at least an hour long. A kind staff member suggested Origin and Bloom at tower 3 and it was the best decision to have a quick snack there. So so good!

The infinity pool never disappoints. Multiple closures due to lightning but don't believe other reviewers that it will ruin your stay. There are 2 for 1 cocktails when the pool is closed! It also never lasted more than an hour and we were back in! Do try the jacuzzi as well.
Poolside snacks are good but limited. I do wish there were more local food options available on the menu.

There was a very rowdy couple one day at the pool. Fighting with one another and swearing so loudly. The woman even asked that someone call the cops. The staff handled this situation so impeccably well. Bravo!

The staff at this establishment are the true attractions. Thanks to Mo, James and Charis at the pool for great service and conversations.

antspants04,Apr 2025,Amazing hotel,"We were really looking forward to this hotel and I’ve got to say it really didn’t disappoint.

We stayed in a double queen room facing the gardens and the view was stunning. The room was a great size, with a balcony and a really well equipped bathroom. I think it was probably the nicest hotel room I’ve ever stayed in. Beautifully done in every way, I really can’t see how the rooms could be improved.

The roof top pool is spectacular, an amazing experience and frankly worth the cost of accommodation.

The only issues we had were breakfast. We are a family of four and went to the rooftop restaurant the first day and were surprised there was no kids menu. The menu for adults is great but not many 10 year olds want an omelette with whipped feta and wild mushrooms. We asked for something less complex and were told no, the menu is as it is. They didn’t even have an apple juice. The next morning we went to the buffet in the lobby and had to wait over 15 minutes for a table which we hated. The restaurant is in the lobby and it feels quite exposed and queuing for food like that felt really awkward. We returned to the rooftop the next morning as we hated the buffet experience but the service on this third and final day was beyond dreadful. We had struggled to be understood on the first day but managed to at least get a plateful of food, this did not happen on the third day. We waited 20 minutes for coffees that never came, the fried eggs we ordered came delivered as some sort of oily whipped meringue-like mess. Genuinely an awful experience so we left and decided to have breakfast at the airport. It was an awful end to what had otherwise been a great stay.

Upon checkout I queried why we hadn’t received the credit towards our spend in the hotel as this was part of my deal when booking. I was told I had to claim this at a machine. This wasn’t explained at all during check-in and we really wanted to just get checked out as the kids hadn’t eaten. They offered to take me to the machine there and then but this felt awkward and time consuming. I think they should make it clearer upon checking in. It was only a hundred dollars but given we’d run up a bill of thousands of dollars in 3 days it seemed a shame to not be able to use it.",4 of 5 bubbles,April 2025,Traveled with family,"Brentford, United Kingdom",en,Amazing hotel,en,"We were really looking forward to this hotel and I’ve got to say it really didn’t disappoint.

simon_stroud,Apr 2025,Amazing hotel - best we have stayed in and an awesome unexpected room upgrade,"We have just returned from an 11 night trip to Singapore and Bali. The first stage of the trip was 4 nights at the Marina Bay Sands, which was definitely the highlight of our whole trip.

At check-in, the receptionist asked whether our trip was for a special occasion. We explained that it was for a joint 60th birthday plus a retirement, thinking perhaps that we might receive a cake or something. We were instead informed that we would be upgraded from our booked room (""Premier Garden View"") to a room in their ""Paiza"" floors, which turned out to be a ""Paiza Bay Suite"". This was a fantastic and totally unexpected upgrade - I won't go into details of the room - everything is on the MBS website, but basically it took our stay to a whole new level.

The Paiza rooms benefit from many perks including butler service, breakfast/brunch, afternoon tea and evening drinks/canapes in the exclusive Sky Lounge on the 55th floor. We made full use of these facilities during our stay and the experience and service were first class.

The room facilities were excellent and could not be faulted.

One tiny tip - I did have some trouble connecting to the Chromecast facility on the (huge) TVs in the room, but it turned out that each TV has a little cupboard at the bottom left corner hiding the very useful HDMI input connector so that worked much easier.

Of course the infinity pool is a must-use facility. Unfortunately our stay was rather short so we only used it once but the pool and amazing views across the city were very memorable.

Voyager170656,Apr 2025,Great hotel for families,"What a hotel! I travelled across Asia with my young family (3 children) and visited various cities - all were 5 star resorts. I wasn't sure whether to book this hotel as it was over double every 5 star ""equivalent"" but I am so glad I did. The service was great, staff attentive and rooms were lovely. We had an interconnecting room facing Gardens By The Bay (I would recommend). I had one small issue at check-in which I forgot about but it was logged and management (Abdul Rahman Bin Umar) sorted it out proactively. The only niggle is the queue for breakfast can be long (c15-20 minutes) however it is worth the wait - the options/selection on offer is so good! We are back in London and still talk about this one hotel. The big highlight is the pool on the 57th floor - we were there throughout our trip including 11pm in the evening - it was a special highlight.

david C,Apr 2025,Too Expensive and a Disappointing Experience,"We visited Marina Bay to go on the observation deck in the morning. This for two of us was $75SDollars. This is quite a lot of money but we were expecting to be amazed and see so much at the top.
Oh dear.....the poor tourist is confined to a very small potion of the roof space (probably about 1/8th on the left hand side of the photo image on the left. There is a somewhat overpriced minibar up there where a small can of coke is $5 - so we shared one like most people up there, Perhaps given the cost of getting up there a small drink could be included (especially since on a fine day with the sun out there is no shade or cover up there and it is absolutely baking hot.
On arrival at floor 56 and stepping out the lift it is 'compulsory' to have your photos taken. When you walk around the other side a member of staff is quickly finding the taken image and sell it to you for another $70SDollars - A right rip-off without asking permission in the first place. Interestingly the roof is arranged that to use the toilets you have to go to the exit. So if you go to the loo on arrival (because you need to) you are immediately pointed to the down elevator. Needless to say we ignored this instruction and went back out again as a 4 min stay seemed a little short. What a stupid design.
The view from the deck is very good but that is all it is - You cannot move around the rest of the deck and get other views and perspectives. It is too expensive and disappointing for what it is , you are treated as being in a sausage machine - take your money and get you up and down as quickly as possible .

Paul F1132,Apr 2025,A modern sanctuary,"It is seen from a distance, as a line stretched between three towers, a footbridge placed on the future. Marina Bay Sands is not a hotel, it is a symbol. A feat of architecture set on the bay, facing the light city of Singapore. We come here for luxury, of course, for elegant rooms, shopping galleries, Michelin-starred restaurants... but what we come looking for, what remains etched in the memory like an explosion of beauty, is the view.
On the 57th floor, everything opens. The sky, the port, the city. There, suspended in the heights, an open-air bar welcomes you. No needless flashing. Luxury here is the altitude, the space, the light. We sit down with a drink in hand — a cocktail with Asian accents, a New World wine, whatever. The main thing is elsewhere: Singapore at your feet.
The bay unfolds like an origami of glass and steel. Below, the Gardens by the Bay gardens draw their futuristic plant forms, huge metal trees pop up like a dream of Miyazaki. Further on, the port rustles with a distant activity, silent from the tops. And all around, the city. Vertical, effervescent, ordered like a giant microprocessor. A world-city, a 21st century city on the move, where nature slips between the towers like a breath. There are crystal-clear greenhouses, bridges, slender buildings, streets lit like arteries.
At night, the panorama becomes a spectacle. The bar turns into a headland on a world of lights. The laser show, the shimmering bay, the reflections... each sip becomes contemplation. We don't talk anymore. Or in a low voice, like in a temple.
Because that is what Marina Bay Sands is all about. A modern sanctuary. A steel and glass cathedral dedicated to the beauty of the world as it is built today. You can feel the power of Asia, the momentum of the future, but also, in the calm of this 57th floor, an unexpected form of peace. The tumult stays down. Up there, the wind grazes faces, the lights flash in the distance, and we understand that traveling is sometimes rising to see better.",5 of 5 bubbles,March 2025,Traveled with family,"Bordeaux, France",en,A modern sanctuary,en,"It is seen from a distance, as a line stretched between three towers, a footbridge placed on the future.

Shoko,Apr 2025,Superior experience at Marina Bay Sands,"Visiting Marina Bay Sands had always been a lifelong dream of mine – and I finally made it!
Everything was beyond my imagination. I especially loved the infinity pool, the breathtaking view from my room, and the gym! Although the gym has moved from the 55th floor to the third floor of the convention center, it was still an amazing facility.

They had not only treadmills but also a wide variety of weight machines. Since I prefer weight training over running, it perfectly matched my expectations.

I was also incredibly grateful for the support from two lovely staff members, Chanok and Roselyn. They were so kind and helpful – thank you both so much! (Safe travels to Japan!)

Some people might think it’s strange to have a training session in the middle of the day at Marina Bay Sands, but because I truly love working out, having a session in such a special place was unforgettable. I’d definitely love to come back again in the future.

By the way, the scent at the entrance of Marina Bay Sands was absolutely amazing. I’d love to enjoy that same fragrance at home.

Dyson hairdryer, mobile charger plate, Jo Malone toiletries, Toto toilet, cocktail bar…. Balcony peaceful and private with wonderful views over the gardens and water beyond.
However, the arrival experience was really disappointing. The lobby isn’t really a lobby and is BUSY. You have to remember it’s part of a huge shopping/activity complex so there isn’t the usual relaxing lobby area where you can sit in comfy chairs with a drink and watch the world go by. There’s no separation between hotel guests and the general public. No doorman to greet us and take luggage. Check-in times strictly adhered to, so don’t turn up early. Our specified room wasn’t ready even after check-in time so we were compensated with a free breakfast, which was tasty but I would have still preferred the room to be ready.
Swimming pool is a unique selling point and had been on my bucket list for some time. But it’s BUSY. And whilst I managed a brief swim, most people are there to take selfies and look at the view (both of which I did too) but for extended periods of time, so don’t expect to be able to do lengths.

ElNinoDorado,Apr 2025,Spectacular Opulence,"There were some concerns about the mall/airport/casino/obnoxious influencer vibes that other visitors mentioned, but my party of five wasn't exactly looking for tranquility. With something for everyone, and proximity to the MRT, after some deliberation, I settled on MBS for our three night stay in Singapore.

We arrived well after the appointed check in time, but the room was not yet ready. The receptionist generously granted S$100 credit to use at any hotel restaurant for the delay. She asked if we were celebrating any special occasion. I mentioned it was a family reunion of sorts. She offered a room upgrade to what I think was the Paiza Signature Suite with City View, but our room was much larger than what is described on their website. Truth be told, I was reluctant at first, being that we had two rooms booked with a need for space, but she assured me that this would be special.

We headed off to RISE, and were seated right away. The buffet was outstanding (better than the breakfast), but to elaborate would require a separate review. Within ten minutes, I received a text that the room was ready, so she didn't really have to do all that for such a minor inconvenience, but she did, and hey, we were all better off for it.

Our suite was located in Tower 3. I did feel the airport vibe, but the lobby is just massive, so it's not as if you're maneuvering around people to get to where you're going. We finally got to our room, 4769, and our jaws just dropped. Gleaming marble floors, kitchen island, karaoke room, artwork, sculptures, dining room, living room, bathrooms, wardrobes, toilet seats that automatically go up when you open the door, it was just overwhelming. Words cannot describe. I took about four showers per day, not because I had to, but because I wanted to, and it had nothing to do with the Acqua di Parma toiletries.

The Infinity Pool (valid proper noun status) was downright relaxing, and never crowded. We ate Lavo twice, once dine-in, and once to go. Chilled a couple of times at Ce La Vie, which was ok, but you're better off getting your drink on poolside until 0000. Breakfast at RISE was very crowded. I would advise to get there early. I did check out the casino, but gambling is not my thing, and smoking is permitted, so that was a quick exit.

Admittedly, the fortunate upgrade enhanced my experience beyond all expectations, but in the end, we spent more time outside of the room than in it. The entire structure is impressive, you have the Supertree Grove in the back, fountain show at night, stunning skyline views, and the MRT to whisk you away for further exploration.

Martindv,Apr 2025,"A Dream Come True at Marina Bay Sands, Singapore","Sometimes, there are hotels you dream of staying in, but they seem just out of reach. During our last vacation, we made one of those dreams a reality, even if just for one night. Our dream was to swim in the world-famous infinity pool on the 57th floor of the iconic Marina Bay Sands hotel. After taking the leap and making the significant investment to check off this bucket list item, our adventure at this remarkable hotel began.

Upon arrival, we were immediately struck by the incredible architecture and sheer scale of the hotel, which was overwhelming in the best way possible. However, due to its massive size, the check-in process felt more like checking in at an airport, with long queues and a less personal experience than we have had at other 5-star hotels. That being said, the reception staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming. Our son was immediately offered a treat, and since we were celebrating our 11th wedding anniversary, we were upgraded to a high-floor room with a balcony facing Gardens by the Bay. This upgrade added an extra layer of luxury, as we were able to watch the nightly light show from the comfort of our own room. Additionally, we were given early access to our room before the official check-in time, which was highly convenient, especially when traveling with a small child.

Once we entered the room, we were simply blown away. We have stayed in many beautiful hotels, but the attention to detail in this room was unparalleled. Every inch was thoughtfully designed to exude luxury. The bed was enormous and fitted with exceptionally soft and high-quality linens. The minibar was uniquely integrated into a stunning Chinese-style tea cabinet, adding a touch of elegance. The bathroom was spacious, beautifully designed, and stocked with premium amenities from Jo Loves by Jo Malone—a brand we were unfamiliar with until we looked it up and were amazed by its exclusivity. The amenities even included a pillow mist for relaxation, a delightful touch.

Then came the highlight of our stay: the infinity pool. After taking two elevators to reach the top, we were warmly welcomed with complimentary water and towels. There was plenty of space around the pool, but one drawback was that many adults without children occupied the family-friendly section, making it uncomfortable for families with kids. Unfortunately, some of these guests seemed annoyed by the presence of children playing, despite there being a designated adults-only area, which, ironically, remained mostly empty. It was disappointing and frustrating, as proper signage was in place, but some guests clearly ignored it. Nevertheless, we thoroughly enjoyed our time at the pool, soaking in the breathtaking views. On our first day, with perfect weather, we could even see Malaysia and Indonesia in the distance.

For dining, we had both dinner and breakfast at Rise, the hotel’s restaurant located in the lobby. The dinner experience was excellent, while breakfast, though good, was quite crowded and felt a bit generic compared to other luxury hotels.

Overall, our stay at Marina Bay Sands was truly unforgettable. It was an expensive indulgence, but the experience was worth every penny. From the unparalleled views to the luxurious room and the iconic infinity pool, it was a dream come true. If you’re considering a stay, even for just one night, we highly recommend making it happen—it’s an experience you’ll cherish forever.",5 of 5 bubbles,February 2025,Traveled with family,"Heemstede, The Netherlands",en,"A Dream Come True at Marina Bay Sands, Singapore",en,"Sometimes, there are hotels you dream of staying in, but they seem just out of reach.

Luke V,Mar 2025,Pleasantly surprised every step of my short stay,"Came here as the start to a bucket list solo trip with the infamous infinity pool being a big focus at first.

But that’s where I was surprised in a great way. From the moment I got out of my cab, staff was attentive and welcoming every part of the way.

As I was checking in, there was a minor quip of not having the room I booked available (balcony w Gardens by the Bay view) but it turned out for the better because they gave me a suite instead. Which to be quite honest was beyond my wildest expectations — complete with soaking tub, shower, living room, huge closet area, etc.

The morning after, I woke up early (easier to pull off due to my jet lag) to take advantage of the Infinity pool before sunrise and honestly, it was kind of surreal being nearly solo with that view. It’s also quite the scene to see at golden hour, but it’s definitely more crowded — not uncomfortably so but noticeable. You can also get free access to the SkyPark observation deck from the Tower 3 side if you’re looking for a different view.

The restaurants I went to were solid — both Spago Bar & Spago Dinjng Room, though I recommend booking ahead as slots fill up fast. The best way to describe both is blending European hits with local Singaporean flair.

As for the shops: if luxury is what you want, there’s no shortage there — bring your passport to take advantage of GST refunds.

The instruments used were handled with such sensitivity and purpose. It wasn’t just an auditory experience, it was something you could feel. The sounds led me right down into a Deep meditative state that felt both grounded and wide open.

Nancy K,Mar 2025,Amazing hotel,"We booked the most basic room (given the cost), for one night only, for my husbands birthday. We arrived around 11am, and were allowed to access the pool area before our room was ready. At around 1pm we had a text asking us to make our way back to reception as our room was ready. To our amazement, they had upgraded us to an enormous suite, because it was my husband's birthday!

The room had a balcony overlooking the Gardens by the Bay and the sea beyond. It had a huge lounge and a huge bedroom, a walk in wardrobe, a huge bathroom. The room had so many features - things you didn't know you needed until you had them! Two robes each (one thick, one thin), slippers, heated loo seat, walk in shower, chargers built into the bedside tables. Just UNREAL. I worked out that the room we stayed in would have cost us about £1200 a night, had we been paying, and do you know what, I'd say it was actually worth that. Sublime luxury on so many levels. There was a cocktail stand with everything you needed to make several cocktails and so many snacks too. We didn't use these as they were chargeable. They also delivered a cake to the room!

We went to the pool and stayed there for a few hours. The infinity pool is amazing. Also, the beds mostly were double cabana type beds with sunshades which were really comfy. We both had burger and chips at the pool and 2 bottles of wine to share - all very reasonably priced given the location. We had planned to stay at the pool until it closed, but the room was so amazing that we wanted to spend time in it, so we went back there earlier than planned.

Loads of lovely restaurants at the hotel, but we didn't eat at any, because we ate at the pool.

Stephen J,Mar 2025,Awesome Room and Amazing Staff Made,"I admit it... I'm frugal and I mostly stay at inexpensive hotels. My wife, bless her, usually doesn't complain (as long as she doesn't see rodents).

I made an exception for Marina Bay Sands. It was the final night of a three-month tour of Southeast Asia, and I wanted to splurge. I wanted the most iconic building in Singapore. I wanted a view of the Gardens. And I really wanted to swim in the pool from the movie Crazy Rich Asians. This was kind of a ""bucket list"" item for me.

From the moment we were dropped off, the service was impeccable and exceeded every expectation. Nirmal didn't just help with our bags -- he gave us a suggested itinerary for the evening. Raguvaaran didn't just deliver our bags, he gave us a thorough tour of our room (more on that later) and answered every question. At registration, Ruchelle didn't simply welcome us - she went out of her way to ensure our stay would be memorable. I can't thank her enough.

We were expecting a mini-suite, but our room was larger and nicer than any I've ever experienced: a large living area with a balcony overlooking the Gardens, a huge bedroom with its own balcony, a massive bathroom and a separate vanity. I don't design hotel rooms for a living, but if I did, this is how I'd do it. The attention to detail was evident everywhere: tasteful decoration, flower boxes on the balconies, wireless device charging, a proper bidet, great coffee and tea, delicious chocolates, drapes that automatically open when you enter the room, etc. And the shower was so large, you could have a meeting in there. (Not sure what kind of meeting you'd have in a shower, but still... it was big.)

And yes, we did make it the pool that night after dinner, and the views of the evening city skyline were spectacular.

Let’s start from the cost , now staying with less than 600 € per night is practically impossible .. I at the time not even five years ago booked with less than half the price ..
The hotel is gigantic are three inhuman towers with attached and connected any type of structure , to be clear there is a shopping center so luxurious and so large that ours in Italy in comparison are closets😂, the thing that struck me is the impressive casino the volume of people entering already from the afternoon at 18 ..
The pool on the 59th floor is only accessible for us or guests and honestly I was a bit disappointed. I imagined more luxury ..
The room is nothing that breakfast I did not use and the bridge desk on the 60th floor is great for an aperitif (50 € upwards) but in the end it is all scene this hotel
Great location in front of the gardens next to the museum and certainly in the most beautiful area of Singapore

I was impressed by the wonderful view and hospitality. It was the most memorable place and experience in Singapore.

The front desk recognized that it was a job celebration and tried to provide a room as comfortable as possible on the spot. As a result, we were assigned a wonderful room on a high floor. My daughter was very happy, and I was also impressed by the front desk's response.

We also enjoyed the legendary infinity pool. I was excited to be able to see a magnificent view from any spot in the pool.

I ordered room service in the evening. The quality of the food was very satisfactory. I was also impressed by the polite and prompt service of the staff who served the food.

Emz--699,Feb 2025,The best hotel we have stayed in,"This hotel is absolutely amazing and we both agreed it was the best room we have ever stayed in. We booked one night here as it’s expensive and we wanted to tick it off the bucket list. We paid £400 for the one night which was the cheapest room.

We arrived in Singapore from the US in the morning and were able to drop our bags off the hotel and hit the ground running! Location, location, location! So close to Gardens by the Bay, the MRT, shops, restaurants. Lau Pa Sat and Merlion Park are 10-15 min walks. It made it so easy not to have to sort out details on jet lag and little sleep. The stay was the start of our trip to celebrate our daughter’s college graduation and my husband’s 70th birthday. The hotel kindly and thoughtfully upgraded us to a view of the GBTB and left a birthday cake in our room! We loved seeing the light show up-close at the park and then from our room. The room itself is really wonderfully designed, the curtains open when you walk in, the bathroom is spacious, smart lighting guides you at night to the WC. We had access to the pool (and went both days) without needing to make a reservation (perhaps b/c it was rainy season??) and it wasn’t crowded at all. We had delicious cocktails and appetizers at Spago (all the employees we asked recommended Spago over Ce La Vie) and you feel like one of the beautiful people (JK!). Do make a reservation.

Needless to say, the hotel's architecture is impressive. But that would be nothing compared to the impeccable service provided by the people who bring it to life.

The most unexpected and pleasant surprise we experienced was an upgrade to an incredible suite in Tower 2, recently renovated, all because our room wasn’t ready yet, even though it was past 4 PM. The moment we stepped into the suite, any trace of fatigue disappeared. Everything is tastefully decorated, the spaces are extremely generous, and the view from the windows is breathtaking—you truly feel like a VIP.

The food served in the hotel's restaurants is delicious and diverse, catering to all tastes.

Gardens by the Bay is an irresistible attraction, accessible right from the hotel lobby.

Debbie M,Jan 2025,Marina Bay Sands Experience,"It was a great experience. We were upgraded to a bigger room. From check in to check out we were treated as VIP with a limousine transfer to the airport. There was a hotel staff waiting for us at the airport who assisted us on bag drop, printing of boarding pass up to the immigration entry.
Personally I would like to thank Shataz Ho for being very accomodating to all our inquiries and needs. To our chauffer Peter Ng who was very friendly and entertaining during our trip going to the airport.
Definitely we will come back to Marina Bay Sands with the whole family.

Edwin Ko,Jan 2025,Why did you delete my review? And good facilities but bad services,"My friend and I were staying for 3 nights in this hotel to attend an activity nearby in Nov 2022. At first we were fascinated by how modern and grand everything in this hotel looked, but its services later turned out to be a real nightmare.

The first night started with a disturbing sound from 2:30am for every 5-minute interval arising by the pressure from the pipe system. After 15-20 minutes we could not stand with the noise and decided to call for a check. A technician then came to our room, inspected and asked if we want a room change we should call the front desk on our own, so we explained everything to the reception, but we were offered a downgrade without any compensation or had to wait until the morning for their management team to get back to work. We turned down this unacceptable offer and asked them to reply as soon as possible BUT NOT UNTIL THE MORNING. Half an hour later we were given a same grade of room, with card keys delivered to our new room and our stay extended to 2pm on our last day. Why would such a 5-star hotel have no 24-hour management for emergency situations?

On the next day we were pleasantly surprised they delivered some great truffle chocolates and a bottle of champagne for the inconvenience caused. However on the last day, after we finished relaxing at the fascinating infinity pool on the top floor at 12pm, our card keys stopped working, and after lining up at the lobby with our swimwear to find out what happened, we figured out the card keys worked until 12pm but not 2 as promised. The reception lady named Adele claimed we should approach them for an extension. How in the world will the customers understand THE WAY YOUR SYSTEM WORKS?????? Why are not the card keys being delivered to our room???? Or a note saying our cards should be replaced????

By the time we checked in, we were told that the amounts we spent in Marina Bay Sands hotel mall could be accumulated as points, which can be used to reduce our room price when we check out. However by the checkout time, the same lady Adele decided to settle the payment as quick as she could without even bother asking whether we had any points available. It was not until we raised out how our points could be utilized, she then realized we had points to use. She even urged us to spend more on the hotel shops before even trying to void the invoice so that, we believe, she did not bear any responsibility for her mistakes. However we of course refused to spend further and eventually got our points deducted from the room price by her manager with the previous settlement voided.

We had to say the facilities in the hotels are awesome, including the gym, sauna, steam bath, restaurants, and especially the infinity pool. The rooms are flawlessly clean. However we were very disappointed with this terrible experience happening in a 5-star hotel as an icon of Singapore. The services seriously need intense improvement.

Rooms were great; I stayed both in a suite and in a regular deluxe room and, apart from the obvious differences in the service levels, both rooms were spacious, extremely clean and very well attended to by what must be an army of personnel.

Enjoyed the newly renovated rooms, such as the automated track curtains and wireless charger on bedside table. Bath bombs and complimentary candies provided were a nice touch! However I found the bed too soft, and the aircon too drying, but just a personal preference.

The fitness centre is at the convention centre and is very spacious and well equipped.

Ailin P,Jan 2025,Terrible experience by staff at the pool,"We spent 4 days 3 nights at Mbs from 24th Dec.
Rooms as usual were amazing, counter staff were all courteous and polite.
We were fortunate to attend 2 yoga classes by Bala in the morning and we highly recommend it. He is super passionate and we could feel it it's infectious. If I could rate the experience with Bala its a solid 10/10.

Very unfortunately our entire experience was let down at the pool on 26th morning.
On the 25th morning we went to the pool as quite a big group (we had 4 rooms) and only a few of us tapped in with no issues.
On the 26th , we were stopped by Sandra and her colleague. My sister and a few went ahead first and when I reached with my baby and helper, along with my family. I tapped in my card wanting to enter but was stopped because we were told guests strictly require a card each to enter. What went horribly wrong and distasteful was how this message was delivered. In fact Sandra asked us ' who let you all in yesterday?' I of course couldn't remember who would. When I told her I couldn't she went on asking ' what is their name.. is it one man one woman or 2 women..' a few times... Seriously is it my responsibility to remember who let us in the day before? I felt I was being interrogated??? Ironically in a 5 star hotel. She was exceptionally rude, along with the aunty colleague. My sister who was helplessly standing said when she tried to explain they added a bed so they only had 2 cards instead of 3. The aunty told her ' add bed is bed add card is card'

Objectively speaking, Sandra and aunty did a great job upholding the hotel policy but we are not objects. If the delivery was done better we understand. We truly respect the policy. But not in a tone where we were being doubted like overstayer or non hotel guests!

Can you imagine going to a Michelin restaurant served a wonderful dish but you spotted a fly in it. The whole experience was entirely ruined.

I remember Sandra kept asking for her colleagues names but I recommend your team to check cctv.

Mr Zamora,Jan 2025,"A Once-in-a-Lifetime Stay at Marina Bay Sands – More Than Just Luxury, It’s the People That Make It Special.","Our visit to Marina Bay Sands Singapore was meant to be a special trip for our beloved Dad’s 77th birthday—a celebration we had saved up for as a simple, middle-class family wanting to give him an unforgettable experience. We arrived in Singapore excited but never imagined the overwhelming kindness and generosity that would come our way.

From the moment we stepped out of our cab, we were greeted by warm smiles from the doormen and porters, instantly making us feel welcome. However, what truly left us speechless was Khai at the front desk, who, with kindness and generosity, upgraded us from a suite to the stunning Merlion Suite. We were already feeling a little out of place in such a luxurious setting, but his hospitality and grace reassured us that we were valued guests.

Then came Robby from Premium Services—a man with wit, intellect, kindness, and a heart of gold. He not only ensured we had access to every incredible perk of the Merlion Suite—from indulgent breakfasts and delightful lunches to afternoon cocktails—but also went the extra mile to arrange two limousines to take our entire family (and our many bags) to the airport. His generosity and warmth left us humbled and, at times, even embarrassed by the sheer level of attention we received.

And then there were Justine and Arabella, who truly made us feel like VIPs. Not only did they escort us through check-in at the airport, but they also stayed with us until every bag was checked, every detail was taken care of, and our flights were confirmed. Their level of dedication was something we had never experienced before, and it was done with genuine kindness and care.

We came for the pool, like many do, but we left knowing that the greatest strength of Marina Bay Sands isn’t just its world-class amenities—it’s its people. Every member of the team we encountered was meticulously screened and trained, yet it was their genuine warmth and sincerity that made all the difference.

We never expected to be treated like royalty—we felt out of place, undeserving, and overwhelmed—but the entire staff at MBS treated us with such care and respect that we will forever be grateful. This trip was supposed to be a gift for our Dad, but in the end, we were the ones who received a gift—the experience of a lifetime, filled with kindness, generosity, and memories we will cherish forever.

Aline P Magalhães,Dec 2024,Legal experience!,"The hotel is really a 5 stars luxurious, the service is great, they do room cleaning more than once a day, the amenities are wonderful, the room is huge, beautiful, all technological, huge TV, automatic curtain.
The private is heated seat, opens and closes the lid itself, all automated, very cool.
The view from our room was super cool for botanical garden.
The hotel is a huge shopping area with several attractions.
Breakfast is great, however, do not go with counted time because due to the high occupation usually have a line to get a table, this is something I found bad.
In addition, the fact of being a huge 5 stars makes you just one more person in the crowd, even pq they don't know if you are or not a guest until showing your card, that is, there is no that feeling has exclusiveness / personalized service, but the hotel is indeed the main attraction of the city",5 of 5 bubbles,December 2024,Traveled as a couple,175 contributions,en,Legal experience!,en,"The hotel is really a 5 stars luxurious, the service is great, they do room cleaning more than once a day, the amenities are wonderful, the room is huge, beautiful, all technological, huge TV, automatic curtain.

Charlie C,Dec 2024,Overrated,"This hotel is of course iconic due to the fantastic rooftops and infinity pool. The location is nice and the surroundings are spectacular.
With 2000 rooms this is a factory, but quite frankly, basic some hotel services are not great. Check-in takes too long and was a hassle, while for breakfast I found myself in a line every morning. The procedure to be seated is strangely bureaucratic and is guest unfriendly. This can be much better for this hotel.
Restaurants are good but overpriced. You pay for the view, rather than the food itself. CeLaVi was for us the best.

D D,Dec 2024,A perfect weekend date.,"What can I say about Marina Bay Sands that hasn’t already been said. Although I am going back a while now, I still remember our stay there as clear as yesterday.
We walked into a very busy hotel lobby and were immediately checked in. The staff from beginning to end were exceptionally helpful and polite. We did not have to queue as we were given a private room to check in and have our bags taken up. Effortless! The staff seemed to add lots of little details as I had made them aware it was my partners birthday. The room was immaculate, comfortable and very very clean. The bathroom was clean and the shower was…….fun!
The views over the bay and city were breathtaking through the floor to ceiling windows. You really could not ask for more especially when the light and firework show came on over the bay.
The infinity pool on the top floor is obviously a sight, but I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to get a lounger. Singapore is very humid, so I was expecting the pool to be busy in a Saturday night but it’s huge so there really is plenty of room for all.
The Marina Bay Sands hotel is an experience. It throws lavishness and opulence at you without any grace or style. That’s not a bad thing. It’s the type of place that looks great for influencers and the YouTube generation which is where we are now. There is no space for toning things down. If you’ve just got the money and want to impress a first weekend date, this place is ostentatious enough to fully meet your needs.

TTC86,Nov 2024,Vegas in the tprpoics,"Many choose the Sands for its iconic statue, a chance to take a dip in the infinity pool, easy access to Garden by and Bay and of course, high end shopping, and we are no exception.

The newly renovated premiere suite offers a stunning view over the bay and the Straits. The room is beautifully laid out and appointed, and the state of the art Television can be addictive for bedtime watching. The suite is spacious, airy and brightly lit, with 2 lovely balconies adjacent to the living room and the bedroom. All the modern amenities associated with a 5 star hotel are presented.
The premiere suite comes with premium services that include transfer to and from the hotel, meet and greet on arrival and departure, check in and out are administered in the suite which were highly helpful considering the crowds arriving and departing. The premiere suite also allows access to the club (similar to executive lounge) which, was probably the most disappointing aspect of the stay, as on the 2 occasions that we tried to gain entry (one at around 5pm and the other at around 0930 am), the wait time has been more than one hour, and for anyone trying to have breakfast, make sure that you get in before 8am, otherwise, the wait can easily be anytime between 60-90 minutes. Our stay was over the weekend so perhaps that could be a contributing reason for such long wait, in the end, we did not manage to get any breakfast nor access to the lounge. The other slightly annoying factor is that the hotel lobby provides access to the mall, skypark, and Garden by the Bay (and of course the Casino), so it is swamped by visitors, therefore trying to get help from the staff in the lobby can be tricky, as they cannot differentiate between hotel guests or visitors.

Special mention to Pauline who welcomed us and suggested to have a baby crib put into our room so our 4mth old baby could have a gd nites rest instead of squeezing with us on the king bed 😆

And special mention to the team at premium services that responded on time every time they were texted with an enquiry.

Such response time and service is intimate and made all of us feel welcomed in our home away from home.

This experience you’ve given our family was once in a lifetime and have raised the bar in terms of expectations when I next travel and visit other hotels in the world.

Bougainvillea,Nov 2024,I'm an icon of Singapore after all,"I stayed many times before the coronavirus, but it was the first time I stayed after the coronavirus.

When I used Banyan Tree at the spa the year before after COVID-19, I showed my passport and became a member because I got a membership status of Sands Rewards member Prestige, 10% off meals and accommodation, etc., for a limited time if I showed my Japanese passport.

When the trip in March 2024 was approaching, I wanted to check something out, so I confirmed the reservation by phone from Marina Bay Sands website, where I could also call from Japan, and was surprised to hear that the deadline for Prestige membership had passed, so it would be charged at the rate of the day I arrived.

When I asked if there was a way to retain Prestige members, I was in a hurry to create an SMBC crèca when I heard that if I had some kind of card for the campaign I was running, I could.

When I took a breather and called to confirm at a later date, they told me this time that I could only use the Prestige membership benefits once in the campaign, and that if I made a new card to keep that Prestige membership, it would be ok, otherwise it would be the rate of arrival on the day, but they were wrong, and said they wouldn't worry as the 10% off room rate booked when they were Prestige members would still apply. So, I made a credit card without meaning, but anyway, I avoided the worst of it, which was the accommodation rate on the day.

Safe and checked in on the day. The waiting line is long, but the counter is also full of staff, so we proceed quickly. They hand out water along the way and use the VIP check-in at the back more sometimes, so there is no discomfort. We were lucky enough to be led to a VIP check-in, where we sat on the sofa and checked in.

I definitely wanted a bathtub in the room, so I booked a city view in the Premier Room. It happened to be a corner room, and the harbor view was a bit visible from the bathroom. However, please note that this bathroom is fully visible from the hallway, so if you do not use a roll curtain when using the bathroom, you can see it from the hallway.

The price was higher than before the coronavirus, but it was renovated and the room was easier to use than before.

The bath used to have just a bowl-like bath, but after the renovation, a square-shaped, stable bathtub was fine.

It was fun and nice to have a separate shelf with coffee and tea and chocolate.

You can choose where to have breakfast, but again I had it in the spago on the top floor for the view and the sense of freedom. It's crowded, so it's better to book breakfast as well. Reservations can be made through the WEB .

Be careful not to enter the observation deck at certain times.

Before my stay, I had to deal with a lot of things about the price, but they were kind to me every time I called. However, no offense, but it was a bit difficult because the information was not thorough enough and varied from person to person.

But if you stay, the view is spectacular. And the room was clean, and it was nice to see the housekeeping staff really smiling and welcoming when we passed each other down the hall.

Taxis are also easy to catch in front of the hotel, and there are many hotels where you have to wait a long time to get a taxi, so it's easy to get a taxi, and close to Marina Bay Sands shopping centre and MRT station.

The status of the Sands Rewards Prestige member can also be extended again with this stay, and I have accumulated points (resort dollars), so I want to stay again next time.",4 of 5 bubbles,March 2024,Traveled with family,"Tokyo, Japan",en,I'm an icon of Singapore after all,en,"I stayed many times before the coronavirus, but it was the first time I stayed after the coronavirus.

Flyer28618415739,Nov 2024,Worst Hotel Experience I’ve Ever Had,"Extremely disappointed with my stay at Marina Bay Sands. I was placed in a room in tower 3 currently undergoing renovation which was unbearably loud and the jack hammer drilling lasted for the majority of the day. When I asked to move to a different location away from the renovation I was asked to pay an additional S$200 p/n. I had paid a lot of money for this hotel to begin with and it is the worst hotel stay I have ever experienced. I had a bad migraine and was unable to leave my room and the ridiculously loud construction work made me feel more unwell. I am shocked that anyone would be placed in a room near the construction with the extreme noise and disturbance. Especially considering the price! I complained several times and asked to speak to the general manager who told me there were no other rooms available in the whole hotel and was offered credit for some food to be sent to my noisy room which was unbearable.

The staff in Marina Bay Sands are just amazing. We met a staff name Charmaine Ho she directed us to go to Gardens By The Bay and gave us tips on what to do next.

We also meet another staff name Victor Mai when we ask for directions on how to go to LAVO, what's more he offered to walked us to the restaurant and waited in line with us until we were seated down.

Simon P,Nov 2024,Nice hotel of a good standard - but not great.,"We stayed here for one night after a cruise. We had previously stayed in Singapore prior to our cruise at another top rated hotel and wanted to compare the two hotels. In the end, the other hotel won (RC).
When we first entered the hotel early morning we found ourselves in a long queue waiting to reach the check in desk. The check in area is very long with many desk clerks. When you reach the desk you are squeezed into a desk area of about 60cm ( it feels like that). I had difficulty maintaining my space as other people checking in kept pushing me. Our room was not ready so we organised to stow our bags and went to explore Singapore. When we arrived back at the hotel we discovered we had received an upgraded room. This was fantastic. We had a view directly on to the marina bay gardens and were level with the flower bombs. These flowers bombs have two shows of illumination per evening and luckily we were able to catch one display. Great display!
The breakfast was good, but not great. There was quite a good choice but we felt the quality of the western food was not up to the standard it should have been. We thought breakfast was included in our reservation details but apparently it wasn’t and that led to a slightly awkward discussion before we entered the restaurant.
The hotel has a wonderful infinity pool on the top floor, and some restaurants. Unfortunately these are not only for hotel guests. The hotel guests have guest only elevators to their rooms and up to the pool area. Somehow we found one person who did not have a room key card for the elevator and she managed to rise to the intermediate transfer level.
I guess this was reported as next day there were security staff checking room key cards at the lift entrances.
One thing we did not like compared to other Asian hotels we had been to was that there was absolutely no welcome greeting as you entered the hotel. The door staff do not care. We think the reason is that there are so many curious tourists entering the hotel that the staff just do not know who is a genuine guest and who is a casual sightseeing tourist. Maybe the hotel should issue the guests with a badge to wear to make it obvious who is a guest! Another problem in the hotel is that there are no seats to sit on in the ground floor area. That means if you have checked out and are waiting for transport or something, you can’t sit down! We asked about seats and were told to go to the roof area where the infinity pool is. The problem there is that there is no air conditioning so, as we were checked out and waiting 5 hours before our flight home, we had an uncomfortable day.

izzyshield,Nov 2024,Good & Bad.,"The hotel itself is excellent, the rooms or should I say suites are really good, comfortable and full of technology. Among the best I have been a guest in. We stayed in 2018 and I now refresh my review due to refurbishment. We weren’t impressed with the check-in which should have been earlier due to our type of booking however, when we arrived, the private check in was in disarray and unorganised. However, on arrival in our suite, we were not disappointed. We ate in the Lavo Italian restaurant, which stated it had a dress code. This was not adhered to and we found our selves in amongst women in jeans and men in shorts. It was quite pricey and the food quality was disappointing. This did take away from the enjoyment of the hotel, however,the access to the rooftop pool and the comfort and excellence of the room & breakfast delivered to our dining area made up for this. We paid a hefty £595 GBP for our one night treat we felt this could have been a lot less due to the check-in and restaurant.",4 of 5 bubbles,November 2024,Traveled as a couple,"Peterlee, United Kingdom",en,Good & Bad.,en,"The hotel itself is excellent, the rooms or should I say suites are really good, comfortable and full of technology.

TO-psych,Nov 2024,Spoiled for life now...,"I stayed here for 2 nights to celebrate our anniversary.

This is truly a bucket list hotel and even though we had high expectations, they were SURPASSED! This is the best hotel I've stayed in my life including other luxury hotels like the Langham or St. Regis. Now every future hotel stay will be measured against MBS!

Of course the location is stunning and the access to the rooftop infinity pool is often cited as the main reason to choose MBS. However, the entire stay was incredible -- I would stay here even without the pool!

The design, attention to detail and amenities are wonderful but what really makes MBS stand out is how well-trained and consistently great the staff are. They are helpful without being intrusive and always kind and courteous, even if we aren't high rollers who stay at these kind of hotels very often. Sometimes in fancier hotels it can feel stuffy or snobby, but here I felt they treated everyone well, whether you are wearing designer clothes or you're like me in your Uniqlo gear :P

Room:
We got upgraded to a suite - maybe because we said it's our anniversary or because they are doing construction on tower 1. They also surprised us with a chocolate cake in our room with ""Happy Anniversary"".

The room was huge with a nice city view, impeccably clean, cozy design (I wish my living room looked like this), everything you could possible need. Smart lighting and temperature adjustment. Smart TV. Waffle AND terry cloth robes. Slippers of different sizes (as a woman with small feet, I usually never use hotel slippers as they are one size and usually way too big). Bath tub with a tray to hold your phone etc and bath bomb AND bath salts. Jo Malone toiletries. Toto toilet. Dyson hair dryer. Speaker in the bathroom so you can listen to music/TV while in the bath. Jewelry box. Chocolate truffles. TWG teas. In room pre-mixed cocktails (extra cost but very reasonable, like $19 each). Super cozy bed with nice linens. Nice design-y coffee table books. Free MBS postcards. Thoughtful turndown service -- they noticed I was using a ratty old movie ticket as a bookmark and stuck a beautiful MBS bookmark in my book!! Like COME ON, talk about attention!! If your charger is really long, they will wind it up and clip it in place. It's basically like being at home but BETTER.

Wellness:
The spa is sadly closed at this time. But I took advantage of the free access to wellness classes for hotel guests (normally around $30 for the general public). I did the morning sound bath on the observation ticket. What a magical and unique experience! So relaxing and peaceful. I also signed up for the morning pilates class but it was raining so it was cancelled. Instead I went to the gym. For the past year the gym has moved to a different building but it is attached to the hotel via underground and you can walk there in 5 mins, passing by the casino. The gym has state of the art equipment and everything you would expect including cardio machines, free weights plus extra like that mirror fitness app (you do classes using the app), massage gun, fruit infused water, coffee/tea, lockers for your valuables and headphones in case you forgot your own. There is a change room attached as well, in case you already checked out of the hotel and need a place to freshen up. Arif and Lucy were very kind and helpful in orienting me to the gym area.

Food:
We didn't eat at any of the restaurants except for breakfast at Origin & Bloom (casual grab & go cafe in the lobby) one day. Great cappuccino and breakfast sandwiches, reasonably priced. The food court at the Shoppes @ MBS is really nice and has great variety.

Pool:
Amazing. Be sure to visit during the day and at night for different vibes. I was worried it would be crowded since it is such a famous pool. But it is really long, so even when it is busy, there is no problem finding your own space in the pool and getting lounge chairs. There are always staff around to help you get a towel. There's also a free sunscreen dispenser, so smart. Keep in mind there is not a lot of shade in the lounge area (no umbrellas), so sun protection is a must. The pool itself is shallow and I swam around a bit, but it's more of a pool to relax in rather than to swim laps.

There is a professional photographer going around in the pool and taking photos that you can buy later, but we chose to just take our own photos (bring a waterproof phone cover - or buy one from the gift shop). They have discounted drinks at night (I forgot what time but it is 2 for 1). It's easy to miss the jacuzzis which are facing the opposite direction as the infinity pool. Those are really nice at night!

Check-in/check-out:
Smooth and efficient. They collect your luggage right away from your taxi/car and tag them so that by the time you are checked in and go to your room, your luggage is there waiting for you. Express check out was easily done online and then you just drop your keys at the desk.

Overall, so impressed with this hotel. It's basically flawless and lived up to the hype. Would stay here again when in Singapore.",5 of 5 bubbles,October 2024,Traveled as a couple,"Toronto, Canada",en,Spoiled for life now...,en,"I stayed here for 2 nights to celebrate our anniversary.

We had a gardens view room on 14th floor - view was breathtaking. Very modern and well-appointed room.

Not all rooms have these, but so surprised when the selection opened up. All the finest things are in there- from the Jo Malone soaps and lotion to the best TWG tea flavors! The service is just way and above expectations: the welcome chocolates are so good and other treats are so fancy! I am really impressed on how they show their gesture of hospitality. They even gave a cute, Marina Bay Sands Lego set that my son was eyeing on for his birthday. Too many nice things to mention, but specially the warmest welcome and service we got from the time we were picked up from our previous hotel...riding their Limo Van really made us all feel so VIP, up to the private check in process by Ms. Glaiza and Ms. Julie (both charming and very warm and very accommodating ) , up to the concierge - Leo really explained all the good places to visit, complete with different maps and illustrations. They know how to treat their guests here. Nothing bad to say about this hotel, all are above super special only. The pool is the best in the world, by the way, and the view up there is just spectacular. One should expect though, that this is a luxury hotel, and it does not come cheap, but it's just so worth it.

We arrived early in the morning & unfortunately our room wasn't available but we were allowed to access the infinity pool. We had packed our swimming costumes in our hand luggage so we could enjoy the pool for several hours until our room was ready.

My only criticism is that it would have been nice if just one section of the huge pool area didn't have the constant beat of bass 'music'. That apart, I loved the pool & we enjoyed having it almost to ourselves. Reception emailed me when our room was ready & we were delighted when we saw our beautiful newly refurbished room on level 21 of Tower 1. Spacious & tasteful. The bed & bedding were so luxurious & comfortable. Bath, separate shower & toto toilet, double sinks, espresso machine, enormous Samsung tv & 2 armchairs fronting a superb view over the river. (We were told that soft drinks in the minibar were complimentary but on check out we discovered that wasn't the case.) The room was so quiet. We never had any sound from neighbours or from outside. We only had breakfast one morning as we checked out early the 2nd morning. There was a very small wait to be seated but the efficency of service, choice & quality of buffet were impressive.

El-Cholestero,Oct 2024,A perfect stay in a perfect hotel.,"We booked a Gardens by the Bay view suite for five nights. A couple of days before we were due to arrive, we were contacted by the Premium Services team to ask if we wished to have a complimentary car pick us up. We took advantage of their offer. A driver was waiting for us at Changi airport and got us to the hotel. When we arrived, Frina, our private checkin person, was awaiting us along with a bellman to get our bags. We were whisked up to our suite (upgraded to the Paiza residences!) and we did the checkin inside the room. Frina could not have been friendlier or more professional. She is a great ambassador for the hotel. Once all that was taken care of, we enjoyed our five nights.
It's a hotel and mall complex, right next to Gardens by the Bay. So, if you don't want to leave the complex, you have all the food and shopping you need. If you do want to explore what Singapore has to offer (and of course you do!), you are really close to a metro station and you can go anywhere you want.
You're right next to Gardens By the Bay, so visiting it is really easy and convenient.
We had a buffet breakfast included in our meal; Rise is where the buffet is, and it has a great deal of various breakfast options for your dining needs. The lunch buffet is in the same place and has just as many options, including seafood.
Your room key gets you free anytime access to the observation deck and infinity pool on the 57th floors. Take advantage of this; get on up there and enjoy the views. We hit the pool in the afternoon and found it easy to get a lounge. There are also jacuzzis up there.
The suite was spectacular; every modern convenience. The end tables had wireless charging units built in plus USB plugs. The bathroom has a bidet operated by a keypad. The shower has regular showerhead, horizontal showerheads and the rainfall showerhead. Jacuzzi bathtub, of course.
Gigantic TV in living room and smaller one in bedroom. Curtains (sheers and blackouts) operated by wall switches.

The 2 nights and 3 days at Sands Premier Suite, Gardens by the Bay View (King Bed) was really great, and I definitely want to come back again.

On the last day, while going to the airport using the limousine service, we realized that we had left our first little boy's favorite pillow behind. When we were about to give up, the hotel delivered only the pillow through another vehicle, and thanks to that, our child was able to successfully complete the 7-hour flight. I can't forget the look of happiness on my son's face when he saw his pillow at the airport. I sincerely thank you for protecting my child's innocence and making good memories for our family. In particular, Jevic Navidad, who took care of our family at the airport and saw us off, and the driver (I don't know his name..) who contacted the hotel and worked hard to get us to the airport and receive the pillow, thank you very much.

When we were about to give up, the hotel delivered only the pillow through another vehicle, and thanks to that, our child was able to successfully complete the 7-hour flight. I can't forget the look of happiness on my son's face when he saw his pillow at the airport. I sincerely thank you for protecting my child's innocence and making good memories for our family. In particular, Jevic Navidad, who took care of our family at the airport and saw us off, and the driver (I don't know his name..) who contacted the hotel and worked hard to get us to the airport and receive the pillow, thank you very much. We made good memories, and we will definitely visit again. Thank you."

Andreas M,Oct 2024,Epitome of Luxury,"I never expected that this hotel would live up to the hype, but actually..it did better than expected.
The hotel is just stunning..grounds, views, infinity pool, restaurant, breakfast..can't really find any flaws. Yes, it comes with a hefty price tag, but it delivers.
Our experience begins at an extremely busy lobby, that somehow runs like a well oiled machine and we were speaking with reception staff within 2 minutes. We had the pleasure to be checked in by Katie (catiee ?) who I believe was on her first day at the job on 18/10/24. I hope this message reaches her, when we say that she was an absolute delight, really polite and really elevated our experience from the beginning.
We were then shown to our paiza deluxe suite on the 47th floor, and dear me...the room, the size, the design, the feel was just 6* experience. Everything in the room makes sense. Special things that were really standing out: 1. DIY tea ritual with high quality teas provided 2. high tech room controlled by tablet 3. smart TV in the bathtub room.
All in all, a hefty price tag, but definitely delivers in quality.

From the moment we checked in, their outstanding staff fulfilled every request from assisting with dinner reservations, city tours and even transportation to the airport. Marina Bay Sands’ exceptional service indulged our whims, surrounded us in tranquility, and provided us with endless opportunities to explore their magical one-of-a-kind world-famous hotel at our leisure.

Their attention to every detail ensured we experienced unparalleled comfort during our stay at this incredible haven of luxury, filled with stunning décor, and elegantly furnished rooms. Their infinity pool was sublime, with spectacular views of the city, and their restaurants' meals were decadent.

Victor also secured our dinner reservations at Spago, their rooftop restaurant, and escorted us to our table. Daniel Tuang, also greeted us at check in and provided us with a wealth of premium services information.

Joshua K,Oct 2024,Dream experience,"From even before my arrival in Singapore to the moment I departed, Marina Bay Sands provided an exceptional stay and experience. My room was large with excellent amenities and had a beautiful view of Gardens by the Bay. The infinity pool is stunning and I found myself watching the sunset from the pool every night. Daily breakfasts at the Rise restaurant were of high quality with many options across a variety of cuisines. And my jaw dropped the first time I entered the casino floor - it felt like I was in an opera house.

I would particularly like to thank David and the entire Premium Services team for their care in assisting with my stay. I was surprised and delighted to have them organize airport transfers for me, and additionally received a bottle of champagne in my room upon check-in to celebrate my birthday.

As a surprise for everyone, I booked Marina Bay Sands, and it definitely did not disappoint. I booked 2 Sands Premier King rooms (one was upgraded free of charge to a suite for my partner and I), the newly renovated ones, and they were absolutely stunning. The attention to detail blew us all away, from the curtains opening automatically when the door to the room is opened, to the heated toilet seat and integrated bidet with warm water, the cocktails in the room, 2 huge TVs in our suite, fabulous views of the Gardens, the most comfortable bed we've EVER slept in, dressing area with lovely lighting, deep bath complete with bath salts and bath bombs...honestly, the list is endless. This was sheer luxury and we loved every minute of it. Despite there being renovation works at the hotel, we didn't hear anything, our room was really peaceful and we slept well. We spent a few hours by the iconic infinity pool, which really is stunning; we took advantage of the cocktails and snacks by the bar. This was a once in a lifetime experience for us and we absolutely loved it. The staff are superb, couldn't do enough for us. The only downside was the length of time we had to wait to check in at the desk. I'd tried to check in online, but the system didn't like 2 of our (older) UK passports.

The attention to detail blew us all away, from the curtains opening automatically when the door to the room is opened, to the heated toilet seat and integrated bidet with warm water, the cocktails in the room, 2 huge TVs in our suite, fabulous views of the Gardens, the most comfortable bed we've EVER slept in, dressing area with lovely lighting, deep bath complete with bath salts and bath bombs...honestly, the list is endless. This was sheer luxury and we loved every minute of it. Despite there being renovation works at the hotel, we didn't hear anything, our room was really peaceful and we slept well. We spent a few hours by the iconic infinity pool, which really is stunning; we took advantage of the cocktails and snacks by the bar. This was a once in a lifetime experience for us and we absolutely loved it. The staff are superb, couldn't do enough for us. The only downside was the length of time we had to wait to check in at the desk. I'd tried to check in online, but the system didn't like 2 of our (older) UK passports. In no way, however, did this detract from the experience we had at Marina Bay Sands."

Ok it is not cheap compared with other hotels, but each time it was a pleasure. We loved the room, probably one of the most comfortable beds I have slept in. The infinity pool is always amazing, and the staff always provide very attentive service.

rajisaone,Oct 2024,Amazing Experience,"As a cabin crew member who gets to experience different hotel stays around the globe I decided to treat myself a one night stay at the Marina Bay Sands and it didn't disappoint in any way.
A personal big thank you to the upgrade and excellent staff in-particular Justin VIP check in desk, Rafeal infinity pool, Shivandasani infinity pool apologies if not spelt your name correctly and Madurai luggage.
From the moment I arrived getting my key, was fast and efficient, luggage already waiting in my room. My room was amazing with Marina Bay Views. The bed super comfy and pillows, nice amenity kits etc plenty of complimentary water in the room with teas and coffee.
Room was quiet and well insulated....
Infinity pool access with towels and water on hand. Staff really friendly and approachable used the outside jacuzzi eventually found the on button overlooking the Garden Bay ...
Enjoyed my buffet breakfast, especially the cooked gammon slices, plenty of choices at Rise got there early morning as was told can get really busy and im sure it could be rather chaotic after 8am, as I arrived at 06:45 the only hiccup is I ordered another coffee and waited a while and went to ask another attendant who served it straight away.
After checking out at 11 am I left my luggage whilst I did a bit of shopping MRT mega close by as shopping mall casino etc.
On checkout was giving a key to access the infinity pool which was nice.
All I can say from my own personal experience amazing 10/10 and the staff play a big part on first impressions and my overall experience was unforgettable, would return in the future

Persephone S,Oct 2024,Never even checked in!,"Wow where to begin. Booked this back in may for my honeymoon.
First issue it's getting renovated so it's half a building site and you can tell from the outside and the inside it's not subtle ( I checked beforehand).
I booked a premium room with bespoke cocktails. Waited and waited for them to contact me regarding what I wanted in the armoire. Finally contacted them to find that this is now apparently an extra service fee on top of the room cost. Nothing but coffee is included. I spoke to lucas who told me I was paying for the convenience of the room. Well duh that's what rooms are for but I've never stayed in a suite or premium room where every facility given was then charged as extra.
I then see that the price on the website is less than I paid way back in may. They wouldn't even take the difference off the room cost. No gesture of goodwill given.
The check in process is basically a circus we already gave our passport details but we're then warned there would be a huge queue which may take an hr or more. To check in! As a premium customer folks not the basic room. I then got warned of restricted pool times where u are counted in and queue again if it's full. So basically I decided I didn't want to stay in a hotel that was prepared to give me a sub par service add on costs and a them park style stay to possibly swim in the sky for 700 quid. So I cancelled and they waved the late cancellation fee tye only decent thing they could have done.

The manager Victor apologize to us and showed us a new room. We had to pay upgrade fee but the room was 10000000% better than the previous room. And we learn that this is not the best room Marina Bay Sands can offer!

Victor kept in contact with us during our stay and we are amazed with the hospitality which Marina Bay Sands has to offer. Marina Bay Sands was supposed to be our anniversary trip last spot before we flew back home, what we thought was going to be a nightmare became truly grand finale until the very end.

Marina Bay Sands is, hands down, the best hotel I’ve ever stayed at! The service is impeccable—housekeeping is like magic; nothing is ever out of place, and the room is always spotless.

Supposedly a 5 star hotel, my mini bar had a can of coke and a can of sprite as well as juices - where was the beer or wine that most people look forward to consuming after a hard day and checking into a 5 star hotel. In addition, I was placed next to a busy road with no balcony and woken in the morning by drilling from the renovation works that were being carried out in the rooms above.

We then went to the roof, briefly enjoyed the spectacular view and wanted to reserve a table in the bar, but this was not possible with the staff on site. Later in the evening we learned at the bar that we could have made reservations online, which was not mentioned in the afternoon. Fortunately, we still found a table.

The amenities in the room are great. Belinda on reception was so friendly and helpful and was so excited for us staying here for the first time. We had a gardens by the bay view which was brilliant!

Shai V,Sep 2024,"Second return visit, and again great beyond all expectations.","My sister and I returned to Singapore and Marina Bay Sands again this year, after the great visit last year, and this time for three days at the end of last August.
If last year I defined the hotel, and the experience of staying at the hotel, as a ""MUST DO"" when in Singapore, this time it can be doubled at least twice.
From the moment we arrived at the hotel, to check-in, we were greeted by the wonderful ANDY Front Desk, Check-in, who did everything in his power, and even managed to upgrade the room we ordered (at an extra cost of course), so that we got a great room with a great view of the city on the 38th floor.
The room was very large with huge and luxurious beds that gave us a perfect and luxurious sleep.
AGAIN, the bathroom was very spacious, with all the ordinary bathroom amenities, like toothbrush, toothpaste, etc. but in an enlarged size and branded for the Marina Bay.
The rooftop pool - the Infinity Pool - as usual is stunning in its beauty, and especially the view from it. This time unlike last year, and due to the extra time we spent at the hotel, we were able to take advantage and spend more time in the pool. Just pure pleasure.
Breakfast at the RISE restaurant is a delight, with endless options. Starting with Chinese, Western, Indian cuisine and more. Simply suitable for every taste, in unusual abundance, and all in a pleasant atmosphere.
I must mention Mrs. YIN LAY - the ROOM STYLIST, who took care of every shortage and every request we made to her. Just fantastic.
Also Mrs. TAN YA TING - Duty Manager, Front Office, who solved a problem that arose during check-out, quickly (so quickly, that I was amazed - even before we took off back from Changi) and efficiently, and all this in a humane and welcoming manner.

simon m,Sep 2024,Great but overpriced,"On the face of it, this is a great hotel. The staff are amazing and committed to helping you. The infinity pool is a high plus and a great experience. Food and shopping also great. I would have put this as a five but our room was not great for the price we paid. On arrival we were told there was building work going on in the tower we stayed in. This was quite noisy and if I’d of known about this before hand, I might have tempted to upgrade my room to another tower. We were on the sixth floor and our room was next to the very busy road next to us. Very noisy. The air con in the room is also very loud. The bath room door is a sliding door and that clicks when you open it which disturbs the other person in the room. Whilst these are very minor things in an otherwise great hotel, it did affect our overall experience. If the room had been half the cost, I would not have been bothered but for the cost, I was a little disappointed.

Daveygrohl,Sep 2024,"Amazing hotel, be careful with your belongings.","The hotel and pool has been on our families bucket list for many years, when we booked our Asia tour this summer, this hotel was top of the list.
The service is second to none and we were looked after incredibly well by premium guest services, we were met on our arrival and the check in took place in our room. We were celebrating our daughter’s birthday and a cake and birthday gift were organised for us, which was appreciated.
On departure we were given a complementary limo to our next destination and a late check out.
We had breakfast in Rise, which had an incredible choice.
The pool is everything you imagine it to be and more, the only down side to our stay was we left our room key and a watch on our sunbed while we were in the pool. Unfortunately when we got back to the sunbeds these were missing, the hotel did try and locate the watch but this was not found. It’s quite sad that someone would feel the need to take something that doesn’t belong to them, it just shows that even in a premius setting, this can still happen.

Rob K,Sep 2024,Simply Stunning,"We enjoyed an amazing few days at Marina Bay Sands at the start of the month which started before we arrived. Guest services organised our transfer from the city and when we arrived we were met by Eunice who took us straight to our room so that we could begin our journey. Eunice provided us with personalised check-in, very much appreciated and continued to provide welcome gifts throughout our stay. The pool is fabulous, hard to say anymore, and the poolside service is equally as good.

We dined both evenings at the roof top level, LAVO one evening and then Ce La Vi for the other evening. The total experience, food, service, and ambience are all superb. Although a totally different dining experience the breakfast in the morning was again fabulous.

We had thought that maybe Marina Bay Sands would be too opulent, however it was a super friendly experience. It is not the cheapest holiday that we have ever been on, but we recognise that it is a unique experience, particularly with the service provided by all staff, but we do need to mention Eunice who made our stay so match more enjoyable.",5 of 5 bubbles,September 2024,Traveled with friends,4 contributions,en,Simply Stunning,en,"We enjoyed an amazing few days at Marina Bay Sands at the start of the month which started before we arrived.

Jessica L,Sep 2024,Lack of Information / Failed to Deliver,"First thing first. This hotel is amazing and the facilities was excellent. What I do not understand is their claim that information of the renovation in the hotel is ""widely known"" and ""Highly advertised"".

I mean like I have made my reservation for this hotel about one year ago and it was a big anticipated trip. with all the lights and hype going on. KC handled our check in and being nice. She informed us about the renovation works which caught us off guard. Renovation time is from 8am to 9pm!!!! I am here on a holiday not for a sound therapy which does not provide therapy or to be disturbed.

Needless to say we raised our concerns and a manager spoke with us and apologize saying that it was placed on Booking.com and on their website. I mean like when we booked it one year ago where was this placed? where was this mentioned? it was certainly not on the email confirmation we received and all the emails we have received from the hotel team. All they mentioned is we are all excited to welcome you for your stay with not one word of the renovation. We showed them all the emails and they agreed with us! This manager had the cheek to tell me there is nothing we can do as we are fully booked?!

We left the front desk unsatisfied and our room was under whelming apart from the wonderful view of Gardens by the Bay. We reasoned ourselves the mood was killed from our renovation surprise. The renovation works was tremendously impactful. It also shows that there are no sound absorbing layers between floors. Another manager call to apologize again and told us again there was no other room to change. This manager offered us SGD100 credits to offset our bill. We were insulted. The manager offered us SGD 100 for a 3 night stay here in this hotel. That was a joke.

At check out, we once again mentioned our situation and wanted them to proof where did they mentioned in the correspondence with us about the renovation works. They were unable to proof and only could show the current website information before anyone makes a reservation.

We have also written in provided this information on their hotel survey but there was no response from them. How typical. At least other hotels would have the courtesy to reach out to me.

Travellingpeoples,Sep 2024,No to plastic bottles,"When it comes to luxury, this hotel certainly delivers. Although we experienced some miscommunication with a few staff members, Ms. Valerie from customer relations addressed our concerns effectively, making it likely that we'll return in the future.

However, one aspect that needs urgent attention is the hotel's use of plastic water bottles. It's alarming to consider the environmental impact, with potentially thousands of bottles being discarded daily, forming what could be a literal mountain of waste. The justification that plastic bottles are the most practical solution is simply not acceptable, especially when other luxury hotels have successfully transitioned away from them without compromising their reputation or guest satisfaction. Given the premium rates this hotel charges, investing in more sustainable practices should be a priority.

Due to this issue, I’m inclined to rate the hotel at one or even zero for now.

Danno1767,Aug 2024,Worth it in every way...,"Visiting Singapore and staying at Marina Bay Sands has been on our bucket list for a few years now. We recently visited and we can say honestly that it did not disappoint. We love this hotel. Went with our two teen-age daughters. We had a beautiful view of the fountains and Burj Khalifa from our 17th floor balcony. Room accomdations were luxurious and roomy. We felt no detail was missed. Loved the comfiness of the beds, top notch linens and pillows. The Joe Malone co-branded toiletries were superb. The recent renovation came out really nice. We had a smart commode in our room that made even the ""daily duty"" a luxurious experience !!!! We ate at Spago up on the roof, both poolside and in the restaurant. Food was great - loved the spring rolls. The pool is the star of the show. A professional photographer appeared and offered to take some candids and we were glad we did! Another great thing about the hotel is location. You are right in the middle of the Marina section of downtown, making it walkable to the Flower Dome, Cloud Forest, the Super Tree Grove, Art/Science Center, and Lau Pa Sat (the oldest Hawker center in the city). Plus you have a world class mall attached to the hotel. The scents permeated throughout the hotel and with a perfect amount of balance.

My wife and I enjoy playing poker recreationally. I have never played poker in a casino so I thought I would it try it for the first time at this casino. It is a small casino, which for me was a great thing. If you are looking to play your first hand of poker in a casino I believe the last thing I needed was an intimidating casino floor. It is layed out with a nice flow - you cannot get lost in there - and the dealer who handled my table was a true professional who patiently got me up to speed on the difference between casino Texas Hold'em and the typical tournament style most people play at home. I was at a table with 3 Chinese nationals and they were a lot of fun to play with, everyone cheering each other on. I had a great experience in the casino.

We also ate at RISE for the buffet. This was a neat cultural experience as well. The food choices cover multiple culinary cultural specialities and all of the choices were a bit overwhelming. It does feel very busy in there. That being said, the staff was attentive there and the food was really good.

We absolutely will stay here again..

You are right in the middle of the Marina section of downtown, making it walkable to the Flower Dome, Cloud Forest, the Super Tree Grove, Art/Science Center, and Lau Pa Sat (the oldest Hawker center in the city). Plus you have a world class mall attached to the hotel. The scents permeated throughout the hotel and with a perfect amount of balance.

My wife and I enjoy playing poker recreationally. I have never played poker in a casino so I thought I would it try it for the first time at this casino. It is a small casino, which for me was a great thing. If you are looking to play your first hand of poker in a casino I believe the last thing I needed was an intimidating casino floor. It is layed out with a nice flow - you cannot get lost in there - and the dealer who handled my table was a true professional who patiently got me up to speed on the difference between casino Texas Hold'em and the typical tournament style most people play at home. I was at a table with 3 Chinese nationals and they were a lot of fun to play with, everyone cheering each other on. I had a great experience in the casino.

We also ate at RISE for the buffet. This was a neat cultural experience as well. The food choices cover multiple culinary cultural specialities and all of the choices were a bit overwhelming. It does feel very busy in there. That being said, the staff was attentive there and the food was really good.

We absolutely will stay here again.. Primarily for the quality of the accommodations (post-renovation), location, the iconic pool (of course), the many dining options, and the luxurious feel of the entire experience there."

County-Hunter,Aug 2024,Are you willing to pay the bucks?,"Staying here was a tough decision for us. It was our 40th wedding anniversary and we had stayed at MBS for one night 6 years ago. My wife and I were dazzled by the experience and so when we decided to celebrate our anniversary in Singapore, we wanted that same experience. However, the price had doubled since our last stay to nearly $1000 a night, so a three night stay would be nearly $3k!!

But the lure of the world's highest infinity pool and a huge room on the 57th floor like we had last time led us to book our stay. I made it a point to ask for a city view room on a high floor, but when we showed up, all they would do for us was a garden view on the 14th floor. Major disappointment! The front desk clerk took a whole half hour trying to search for different combinations, but unless I was willing to pony up another $9,000 a night, there was nothing she could (or would) do for us. We are not rich people but will splurge occasionally for something like MBS.
Other than our disappointment, our stay was fine. The hotel is amazing. We spent much time in the pool and were able to watch the National Day celebration from the edge of the pool.

If you are visiting Singapore and you have a budget for this hotel do not consider anything else otherwise you will ruin whole trip . Location of this hotel is simply “must have … must visit “ queues for non guest to take a lift at the rooftop are taking from 1-3 hours… crazy . Views from the hotel are simply the best possible- you have to take Marina bay view room . Downstairs there is the best shopping mall in the Singapore as well as all of the restaurants. Walking distance to the Gardens by the Bay is 10 minutes so really comfortable. Weather conditions to travel around Singapore are not so comfortable so it is the best idea to be in the best possible spot .

It’s the hotel offers everything which makes the stay so easy and comfortable, there’s really no need to go very far as the hotel has it all. Great shopping, amazing restaurants, gardens by the bay. The service we experienced was great. We arrived early and left our bags to go exploring and they called us when our room was ready before the check in time.
The pool is the real highlight. The views are incredible. I wish they would section an area off as adults only though because there were children splashing around everywhere and it’s not what everyone wants. The pool area is so large they could easily have 2 separate areas. There is a separate children’s pool but the children were everywhere.
We stayed in tower 3. Our room was perfect, great view, luxury toiletries, cleaned really well. There are renovation works being carried out to tower 3 though so we were told there would be some noise in the day and we would need to access the pool from another tower. Accessing the pool from another tower was a bit of an inconvenience as we had to walk through the lobby in swimwear and go down to go back up etc. We were disappointed to be able to hear building works from our room as late as 8pm!!

Emily,Aug 2024,Absolutely Amazing!,"We stayed here for one night to experience the iconic hotel and incredible pool and it was totally worth it. We would normally avoid hotels of this size at all costs, as they tend to lack the personal experience that smaller 5* hotels provide, but this couldn’t have been further from the Marina Bay Sands experience.

From the moment we walked in the doors to when we left the next morning it was wonderful. The staff are the key to this hotel’s success: everyone we spoke to was lovely, very friendly, and helpful. Of particular note were the doormen Johan and Clyde, Julie Ann and Han on reception, and Ravi by the pool - all wonderful assets to the hotel. The staff all seem to go out of their way to be friendly and it made it such a lovely experience. Our room was upgraded upon arrival and we were given a gorgeous big corner room, with a view of both the city and the gardens by the bay - it was truly stunning, and had a massive balcony. The property is truly immaculate and once you get in the lift and go any floor above the lobby it is very quiet and private.

Now for the pool - this is certainly the highlight, it is stunning, with very attentive staff. There are some stunning jacuzzis on the gardens by the bay side as well, and somehow the pool never feels too full of people.

David Jenke,Aug 2024,Sunset In The Sky experience - absolutely amazing!! 😃,"An absolutely enjoyable experience was had by us last night on the top of the Marina Bay Sands (MBS) hotel, tower 3

My wife was browsing for things to do while we were on a 4 night short stay in Singapore
She came across the Sunset In The Sky experience on the Sunset deck of MBS
The cost was $108 SGD each but don’t let that put you off of what it had to offer

We assembled at the lobby area of tower 3 then were met by Adam (who was our guide) explaining what the late afternoon & early evening entailed
He was very pleasant & relational making us feel quite at home
After waiting a short time we were met by another 2 couples who joined us & then we were escorted through the crowd into a very fast but smooth moving lift.. that was quite amazing in itself! 😊

We had chocolate (very tasty & smooth), champagne (Pipers Brook Tasmanian) included in the ticket plus an excellent view of Singapore harbour & further afield
Angel brought us the chocolates & wine making us feeling quite relaxed
We sat at a bar style round table watching the sunset then we were politely shown around the deck overlooking the Gardens By The Bay where a light show took place @ 7.45pm.

Emily was our guide working in tandem with Adam who pointed out particular landmarks as well as being able to see a small portion of Indonesia’s land mass etc.

As the sun started to drop it became comfortable as there was a gentle breeze blowing around us & at the same time, lights on buildings, structures etc. were starting to switch on

Our photographer (Amisur) (?)… sincerest apologize if I’ve miss spelt your name)) did a wonderful job taking pics & each of us received a mini album with different images to the other
24 hours later we will be able to see all the pics online in a dedicated web portal

For further enjoyment to our experience, we were able to pick from a menu some eats & more drinks (of which we did)
The 4 of us in our group simply watched the harbour view quietly for quite a long time making us feeling quite relaxed.. very enjoyable 

Adam said we could stay there right up to 10pm. if we wanted but as great as the light show was & the harbour view, we were all a little tired after arriving into Singapore on the same day leaving there @ 8.30pm.

ECSumi,Aug 2024,Average Crazy Rich Asian,"This place is not cheap but that’s ok. You pay and hope to have some sense of…. Something worth the price/some value? Great check in experience, but the pre-experience should’ve been the red light- this place just wants your money. Let me count thy ways:

1) When I booked the room, I paid the rate that would allow us to cancel. Then I got an email saying I couldn’t cancel. I screenshot what I saw and they screen shot the cancellation policy. Got it but they allowed me to book a room that says I could cancel.

2) We learned we would be there during Singapore National Day, same day as my son’s birthday. I asked if the pool would be open or if I needed to pay extra to be at the pool. No clear response but basically, the response suggested I needed to pay extra. I did- at Ce La Vi. Early bird special. Told my college-daughter about it (BTW- we were in Singapore because she was there on internship) and she told het college-friends so we got more tickets! We were told (website and the many people we asked), come early- first come first serve. Got there early and then were told we could be there until they can sell the table. Why am I paying more and getting there early?

Then, my kids were sent a different route and ended up at a different location, Observation Deck. They tried to order a drink and were told they couldn’t because they didn’t have the right ticket? What?! You directed us there!!!!

3) Talked to the manager- he tried to make it right. Asked us what drinks we wanted and then asked us for our drink coupons that came with the purchase of the ticket. What?! I am paying for your mistake?

After waiting in line for 10 minutes and then waiting another 35 minutes finally the customer services staff at the check in desk found a room for us. I was disappointed and frustrated that the room was not available at their advertised check in time.

When we finally arrived at the room, the room smelled like a mix of perfume and cigarette smoke. I called front desk and asked for a room change but they said they will send housekeeping . Housekeeping came over with a machine that sprays perfume. I kindly informed the staff I don’t want more perfume. I don’t like the smell of perfume. I want a room that doesn’t smell like perfume covered smoke.

Needless to say this was a very disappointing experience after traveling 8 hours to get here to not have our room ready as advertised, and then worse to be stuck with a smokey room.

Michelle M,Jul 2024,"Amazing stay, thank you to all the MBS staff 😍","I never usually write reviews but felt I had to after our stay at marina bay sands.

What can I say other than this place is amazing and we were so well looked after.

We arrived early at 10.40 and from the start we were treated like royalty, our doors to taxi were opened and our luggage swiftly taken away and looked after until our rooms were ready. We were there shown to the front desk to check in.

We stood in a very short queue to check in, and a kind gentleman (I’m sorry I can’t remember his name) took us to the vip booth, where we were given premium treatment, and check in was quick and they found us a room that was ready, so we could take advantage of the facilities sooner. We were shown to our room by frina who was so kind, and welcoming. She showed us to our room and explained how everything worked, she asked us if we were celebrating anything special and I told her we were celebrating my son’s 16th birthday.

10 minutes after she left we received a call from her, to let us know that she had arranged afternoon tea, which was complimentary and had also arranged for a complimentary transfer to the airport when we check out in three days time. This was so thoughtful, so imagine my surprise when after a swim we returned to our room and there was a plate of chocolates and balloons, we are not used to this kind of treatment and were really taken aback and we felt so special.

The hotel itself is nothing short of amazing, our room overlooked the gardens of the bay and we saw the light show every night. We had robes and slippers and lots of bathroom essentials. The bed was comfy and we also had a put up bed for our son and still had lots of room. The mini bar was stocked with soft drinks and snacks and replenished daily.

We had access via wats app to frina who booked restaurants for us and was accessible for all of our other needs.

We had breakfast every day at origin and bloom which is the coffee bar and Jon was an absolute sweetheart, he remembered all of our names and our orders including how I liked just a dash of milk in my tea. This was very impressive and it’s little touches like this that make you feel special.

Now on to the best bit, the infinity pool is the main reason we splashed out on this hotel, it did not disappoint. It is magnificent and the view is outstanding, it wasn’t too busy and we spent a lot of time here. You do not need to worry about towels, suncream or water as it’s all provided as you walk in. There are plenty of beds around the pool, not once did we ever have to get up early and reserve a bed like we have in previous hotels. There are poolside waiters who bring you drinks, a big shout out to Chenna, like Jon he remembered the drinks we liked and our names 😊

Our flight was not until 11pm, so I enquired about a late check out and we were able to stay until 1pm which again was complimentary, so we spent the morning making use of the pool. When we then had transport back to the airport, Charlie was our driver he was hilarious and made the sad journey to the airport (we didn’t want to leave) funny. We were then greeted by a lovely lady (again sorry can’t remember her name) who took use through the airport and helped with checking in and taking us the the correct terminal.

We are a normal family, who work hard, we are not used to staying at luxurious hotels and saved up for a long time to stay at MBS and I have to say it’s one of the most memorable experiences at a hotel and it was worth every single penny. Thank you to all of the staff at MBS for making us feel special and making our stay one of a lifetime.

did not feel that it was crowded. We had enough space to swim and lounge around. And another thing, we did not have to go far to explore our “must-see” attractions list during our stay since the hotel was centrally located. Gardens by the Bay nightly light show was just around the corner from the hotel, as well as the Art Science Museum. The hotel staff was also wonderful and friendly.
The only negative experience I had was at the Food Hall in The Shoppes of the hotel. I ordered food at Rasapura food court, and I had to question my bill with the cashier because she was overcharging what I ordered. She knew I was not a local resident and overcharged me.

Daniel W,Jul 2024,Unforgettable 20-year Anniversary Experience!!!,"We cannot thank the staff of MBS enough for the overwhelming experience we had. From the moment we were picked up by the hotel transfer, to the time we were dropped back to the airport, our experience transcended expectations.

Our trip was for our 20-year anniversary which was a very special event in our lives. The MBS staff made the stay so memorable and extremely romantic. From the decadent food to the alluring cocktails, the staff’s attention to detail and willingness to proactively plan events to enhance an array of unforgettable moments cannot be understated.

A special thank you to Paul and Danial from the butler team who made our stay so pleasurable. They catered to our every need and made our special anniversary trip opulent and sublime. Both Paul and Danial extended us every bit of courtesy, care and customisation to make the holiday distinct.

Sue in the Sky Residence took very good care of us during our dining experiences. In fact, Daniel and his entire team in the Sky Residence were a delight and treated us like family.

Carmichael is a master of cocktails and an artist when it comes to bartending. His magnificent imagination and creativity in making creative cocktails was only matched by his kindness and friendly nature.

The massages with Jane and Lisa were heavenly. A thank you to Shirely for the amazing poolside service. Robby was wonderful with assisting us at the airport.

Truly, every staff member we came in contact with was fantastic. You have such a remarkable team, and we cannot wait to return. We cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. The staff have truly created an immeasurable experience for us and lifelong unbeatable memories.

Other notable staff included Grace, Audrey, Joel, Vella, Ella, Anthony, Camilla and Hua Yi. Thank you all once again.

Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Jul 2024,Exceeded Expectations By a Country Mile,"Only booked here for a recent three day stay in beautiful and clean Singapore because my wife insisted. I was sure this was an overpriced tourist trap, based solely on word of mouth. Boy was I wrong.

First, we booked the Sands Premier Room with breakfast, which I fully expected to be on a low floor with a view of a retaining wall, but imagine my surprise when we arrived at fabulous Changi and upon clearing customs, were greeted with a person with my name on a sign. Turns out the hotel had arranged a complimentary car service for us to the hotel. Wow.

Upon arrival at the hotel (which is as dramatic a building as you will ever see), we had a personal greeter to give us in room check-in services, Double wow. Upon entering the room, we found it was on about the 23rd floor as I recall, facing Gardens by the Bay (which I actually prefer), with a view extending on to the Straits of Malacca, and had a wonderful veranda with beautiful vegetation and a large sitting area. Also welcoming us were a bouquet of flowers, chilled bottle of champagne (which we didnt drink) and chocolates and fruit. All because I had mentioned at booking that it was our anniversary. I’m nobody special either, but I truly appreciate the unbelievable hospitality we were shown. Triple and Quadruple wow.

The room itself was stunning. In Tower 1 so I cannot speak to the ongoing construction that may affect Tower 3 where the entry level rooms are but ours was obviously renovated and had an outstanding bath, with double vanity and a comfortable bed along with a free rollaway bed for our son. Total luxury all around, including automatic curtains, japanese toilet, bath salts for the luxurious tub, amazing bath robes and a leather covered safe.

I was leery about the rooftop pool as I thought it would be an overcrowded nightmare, but contrary to that belief, it was incredibly manageable, especially in the mornings when there were very few people there. I note that Tower 1 entry to the rooftop pool uses the Lavo elevator bank whereas I believe Tower 2 and 3 use the opposite side of the hotel’s elevator banks so the Tower 2 and 3 side seemed more crowded when we were there. Also, Spago sort of cuts the pool area in half so people tend to stay on their side of the rooftop pool.

The breakfast at Spago on the roof was ok, not great. Limited options but the service was friendly and nice and the atmosphere and views cant be beat. That rooftop is just plain gobsmacking all around. The breakfast service at Rise on the ground floor, however, which we sadly tried only once was nothing short of fantastic.
Perhaps the best breakfast buffet I have ever seen outside Italy. Amazing, fantastic and exceptional.

The hotel is attached to an incredible mall and also has a casino. Also has great access to the MRT and from our balcony we watched the GBTB light show. Just a one of a kind experience and I was truly amazed to find that all my fears about being duped into an overpriced hotel were so far from reality that I felt embarrassed that I ever thought that.

n m,Jul 2024,"Speaking of Singapore, MBS","Speaking of Singapore, I think MBS is the only one!
I've been inquiring from time to time for quite some time about staying in a good room, and I felt like the Paiza room at the top was quite controlled, like it was for big guests in a casino. (The reservation people were going to check with someone and didn't give an immediate answer about their availability. We were not casino guests, we just wanted to stay.)

In May (not Golden Week), the three of us stayed four nights in a dual view room with two bedrooms and two baths, which cost around ¥740,000 a day, including the paiza sky residence. Around 5 years ago the orchid suite dual view (which at the time had lounge access in this class) was around 230,000 per night (although it was a bit lower than the paiza floor and a one-bedroom suite), so I thought it was quite expensive. It was a double punch of inflation & yen depreciation.

In the lounge, food used to be snacks like sandwiches and canapés, but in the evening, the food is authentic and becomes a proper dinner. On the other hand, the afnun is fixed, so I get tired of being the same every day.
The seats were more spacious than before, and I felt like I could take my time.
It is now only available to people in paiza rooms.

I wasn't sure if it was for heavy guests at the casino, or if it would automatically follow me if I stayed in my paiza room, but there was a private immigration service at Changi Airport called Jet Quay that put it on for me (they told me it was going to be made or I couldn't, but it did eventually). When we get off the plane, the buggy will be waiting for us and it will take us to a different place from the other guests and we have our own immigration officer. I checked in with zero wait time and was relaxing in the lounge, and someone had saved my luggage for me, and Alphard was waiting right outside the lounge (the fat guest was apparently a Rolls-Royce) and the attendant put my luggage in Alphard. Total stress zero. I went there by ANA, but a lot of other passengers kept coming down from the gates around me, and I wondered what would have happened if I had just gone through immigration normally. Even on the way back, the ANA gate was the furthest away, and they took me to the gate in a buggy, which helped a lot. (They said I could apply directly, maybe $350 per person.) By the way, if you want to see jewel falls, JAL is probably closer.

The paiza room comes with a butler, and I thought it might be good if people wanted us to serve them in a variety of ways, but the sense of distance and communication was difficult. The official language seems to be English, but I don't feel very native, and there have been a few occasions where I've been frustrated by not being able to get it across, depending on the person (we've lived in the US in the past). But I felt a willingness to cover my mistakes.
I was making a Reservation for breakfast at 8 o'clock and got a phone call at about 7:35, and I was like, I'm coming to pick you up, and I'm kind of hectic right now. If you are someone who can do a lot of things on your own to a certain extent, I think there are moments when you feel a little unnecessary.
If you ask them, they make tea for you and put hot water in your bath.

The infinity pool was so crowded that there were cabana seats reserved for paiza, which was great, but the rest of us wandered around looking for seats.

The room was great to see both sides of the city and sea, and the shows on both sides, including the Garden by the Bay side.
It was convenient to just put the iPhone on the side table and charge it (maybe just paiza). Karaoke was included.
Cleaning was normal, but there were three TVs and one remote was out of battery.
The phones were all cordless, and when I talked to Mr. Butler for a long time, the battery seemed to run out, but the hotel said they wanted to do something about it.
I asked for a turndown and they did it normally (though I didn't really need one).
Cleaning clothes comes with two free clothes a day.
You can also have three meals if you substitute Afnun for lunch,
Including the above airport transfer and private entry and exit services
Overall, I didn't think it was really expensive.
In Japan, for example, at the Bougari Hotel, it might be cheap to watch a small room cost 300,000 yen a night, or a two-bedroom room cost 1.2 million yen just to stay.

They made restaurant Reservations, but they also made Reservations for TWG Gardens, which they said were not normally available.

On the way home, I think it was between 7am and 7am.
There were about 30 people, butlers lined up, waiting for the big guests to arrive and it was spectacular. It was like coming in a big Rolls Royce.

Even in Japan, there is the idea of a casino, but Japan has a poor or petty side to everything, and there is a strange tendency to seek equality, so I thought, can we provide a service that satisfies VIPs around the world? (I don't think it's easy to have an immigration office like Haneda Airport where only rich people can go first.)

I hear that a fourth building will be built next to MBS, which may change the landscape. I think he said there were about 500 rooms all in suites.

Does communication happen sometimes? It was good except for this.",4 of 5 bubbles,May 2024,Traveled with family,7 contributions,en,"Speaking of Singapore, MBS",en,"Speaking of Singapore, I think MBS is the only one!

dayadin,Jul 2024,Coming Back Again!,"“Just Wow!”
Stayed for one night at the Marina Bay Sands. Here is a summary of our experience: We were welcomed right when we stepped out of our ride by Jet. JET was so welcoming and friendly. He took our luggage and asked if this was our first visit to the hotel. He gave us a mini verbal tour as he lead us to the reception area where we were welcomed by Patrick. PATRICK (he calls himself trouble. Lol!) made sure we weren’t bored as we waited our turn to check in at the front. He was amusingly entertaining and kind. He lead us over to Nicole. NICOLE was so pleasant and made suggestions as to what we can do for the evening and explained where all the facilities around the hotel were. We got an unexpected upgrade to a higher floor! Thanks Nicole! We did a little walkabout before we headed to our room which was spectacular! Our view was the waterfront and the light show. Amazing! YEZAR brought our luggage up and you can tell that he’s a “people person.” Such a pleasant man and let us know that if there was anything we needed to just contact him. The infinity pool up on the 57th floor is nothing like what we’ve experienced! Just fantastic! Service all around was outstanding. We weren’t sure what to expect from this hotel. Staying at the Marina Bay Sands was part of our bucket list but I think we are ready to go back again for a longer period. All the hype about this hotel is more than expected! Thank you to the staff! Can’t wait to visit again!

Ryan Tan,Jul 2024,Wedding Celebration at Marina Bay Sands,"My wife and I had our wedding party at Sands Expo and Convention Center during the end of June.

Marina Bay Sands was our top choice for location, status, service and quality. But the winning factor to make it the top event location in Singapore is their service team, especially when we were assisted by events executive, Suhana Sudil.

We did not had an easy start as the previous event manager left the team and her service quality was honestly, not the best. Basically, it was hard to talk to her after we signed the contract (a nightmare for all wedding couples). But Suhana turned the tables around.

Suhana was very understanding to our needs to help make our event a unique one for not only us, the couple, but the guests as well. As newly weds, we do not know what to expect, weeks before the wedding, she went the extra mile to explain to us what to expect and run us through the event. She couple easily point out the blind spots we missed out and help to fill in the gaps perfectly.

Personally, i've ran events in many Singapore event spaces and hotels due to my work requirements and i know what it is typically like to run an event. However, the intangible service quality she delivers is a rare gem to find.

Other than her own delivery, she is able to concert the entire team, including security and banquet to help out. This is true leadership at display.

My wife and I were overwhelmed by the praises of the event space and this has to be the best effort of Suhana and her team. We would like to sincerely thank Su and her team in making our wedding a memorable one.

While we were simply on a family holiday and not “highrollers“ we were treated as if we were the most important people in the hotel by the Butler staff.

They were incredible and we will be back to stay at Marina Bay Sands soon because of the butler staff more than any other reason

TheRidders,Jul 2024,Exceptional Hotel with Exceptional Staff and Facilities,"I booked a King Deluxe room with the Gardens by the Bay view which is one of the standard type rooms at the hotel. Check in was 3pm but we arrived at 2pm and reception provided two temporary passes to access the facilities at the hotel such as the Infinity Pool on Level 57, which is only accessible for hotel guests.

Reception then emailed us just before 3pm to inform us that the room was ready and surprisingly, upgraded us to a suite in Tower 3. The room was stunning, with 2 balconies, one with seating for 4 the other with seating for 8. A large living area and entrance hallway. Bathroom had a shower, bath tub and his/hers sink along with branded toiletries. The minibar is stocked and replenished daily free of charge and the hotel also provided us with 8 bottles of water.

With a birthday celebration planned, the hotel left an individual cake in the room which was a brilliant gesture. The cake was delicious as well!

We visited the infinity pool each morning at 6am to take in the sunrise and enjoy the pool whilst it had fewer patrons. Towels are provided when you access the pool and sun beds are on a first come first served basis (same for day beds although premium guests can reserve these I believe).

The hotel staff are all pleasant and polite in every aspect and this clear that this is a professionally run hotel with a passion for quality and standards. The hotel lobby is close to the Bayfront MRT station and the Shoppes at MB are easily accessible as it is adjacent to the hotel.

If I were to stay here again, I would confirm where the upgraded room was."

Pamela C,Jun 2024,Disappointing. Condescension. Stay at Oasia Downtown Instead,"I stayed in Singapore for four nights. My friends and I flew from America and South Korea to reunite (a 22 hour flight for me). We stayed our first three nights at Oasia Downtown (which was phenomenal) and splurged for a room at Marina Bay Sands on our final night.

I upgraded our room to premier specifically for the view—paying around $1500.00 for what was supposed to be a special night with friends. Unfortunately, my stay at MBS was the worst lodging experience we had while in Singapore.

Upon arrival, an employee of the hotel by the check-in line asked me and my friends if we were Deluxe (the cheapest rooms) or Premier. I told him, “I’m pretty sure we’re Premier, but I’ll check my reservation.” His response, “I’m pretty sure you’re Deluxe.” I showed him my reservation confirmation, Premier. He said he was sorry and walked away from the area before I could catch his name. This man made a value judgement upon looking at us, and it was insulting.

Then, our room was not ready at 3:30pm (30 minutes after check-in). We asked the hotel to store my friend’s insulin in a refrigerator until our room was ready as this was time sensitive—and keeping her insulin cool a must. We were told our only option was to accept a room on the 8th floor if we needed to store the insulin right away. We had no choice.

The view was not what we payed for, and it was extremely disappointing. Additionally, guests at the hotel made status judgements of me when getting off at the 8th floor. I was literally called poor. For $1500 for one night, we were looked down upon by guests and staff alike.

I messaged the hotel, and I did not hear back from them until late at night, saying our room was technically premier (in spite of being on one of the lowest floors). While they admitted they handled the situation poorly, they did nothing to rectify the situation.

Was the view from the pool nice? Sure. Was the hospitality of the staff or the accommodations worth $1500? No. Marina Bay Sands is all hype. Save your money. I highly recommend Oasia Downtown, where staff are friendly and accommodating.",1 of 5 bubbles,June 2024,Traveled with friends,3 contributions,en,Disappointing. Condescension.

LuxuryhotelsbyME,Jun 2024,Singapore's landmark and icon,"The Marina Bay Sands is not just a hotel, but an experience and a tourist magnet. The room furnishings and especially the size of the room (approx. 47 sqm) is phenomenal. The view of the port of Singapore and the “Garden by the Bay” is sensational. There is even a small balcony on the 44th floor. A huge flat screen TV in the room. It was the biggest I have ever seen in a hotel room. We didn’t use it though, there is so much else to see.
The design throughout the hotel is an eye-catcher.
Countless restaurants in the lobby but also in the mall on the lower floor. The shops there are all luxury brands and therefore expensive. There is a casino, a small waterway where you can sail in a gondola and of course endless opportunities to invest your money in luxury labels.
The hotel also has its own “MRT” station and you can walk directly from the hotel to the Gardens by the Bay. The hotel is very spacious but there are hardly any stairs, so it is very suitable for people with limited mobility.
Our ""check-in"" was by far the best I have ever experienced in a hotel. Although we were not VIPs, we were taken from the ""normal"" check-in queue to a VIP check-in lounge and were served by a wonderfully friendly employee.
Service is impeccable and always very friendly in all 5* hotels in Singapore. The Marina Bay Sands is no exception. Then of course there is the spectacular pool that you can hardly get enough of. And right next to the pool are various ""Spago"" restaurants and a bar that is more casual.
As the hotel is an attraction in Singapore, there are a lot of people there who want to admire this attraction and use the restaurants even if they are not hotel guests. This leads to very impersonal mass processing and limited times for a stay in the restaurant (max 1 hour in the bar with drinks and food).
The rush of tourists probably just cannot be managed any other way.

The lobby is also incredibly busy and is more reminiscent of a shopping center (which actually starts one floor below) than a hotel lobby. We had booked without breakfast and when I went to the lobby the next day, there was a long line in front of the restaurant, everyone waiting for breakfast. I was glad that I didn't have to wait another hour for my breakfast for the price of €50 per breakfast.
All in all, the Marina Bay Sands is an experience and if you are in Singapore and have the opportunity, I would definitely recommend it for one or two nights. Actually a bit of a ""must have"" in Singapore but you should be aware of what you are letting yourself in for.
If you prefer a more personal atmosphere, you should stay somewhere else. Pretty much everything in the complex is also very expensive.

The rooms themselves were very nice.
Breakfast was an additional 50 euros per person, it was very plentiful, but the price was still excessive.

For dinner, there was a buffet in the main restaurant for 130 euros (!!) per person, which the four of us didn't spend. The restaurant situation in the hotel was a bit difficult overall, so we always ate outside in the evenings.

It was my boyfriend’s birthday and they brought him an amazing chocolate cake.

Candy G,Jun 2024,A Memorable Stay at MBS,"Hi Marina Bay Sands!

Greetings!

First of all, I would like to thank the following people for a warm and accommodating gesture they had given us during our stay:

Senior man at the check in/out counter - I really can't forgive myself for not asking his name or even looked at his name plate. But he was the one who assisted us from the queue (even called my daughter Cinderella). He advised us to proceed to the office to assist us with our check-in.

Jason - didn't get the chance to ask for his surname but he was the one who assisted us on our check-in. He explained clearly all the things that we need to know that would help us to have a comforting stay.

A very warm and kind lady - while I was talking to Jason, this fine lady accommodated us specially my daughter and even gave her a coke and lollipop. It really made my daughter's mood up high. Not because of the sweets though, :) but because of the kindness that this fine lady gave her. Maybe Jason can give her name :)

Hill - when it was our time to get our key cards, she was the one who assisted us. She was warm and all smiles while completing our check-in procedure.

Raymond (GSA - Bell) - upon our checkout, we left our luggage at the storage and Raymond warmly helped us with it.

In general, everyone was very accommodating and warm. From the time we arrived up until we left. It was really a memorable and the happiest vacation me and my daughter had.

Everything inside the room exceeded our expectations: space, bed, complimentary stuff, bathroom, powder, TV... EVERYTHING!

I'd like to end this email with a huge thanks for upgrading our room. It doubled the fun and happiness of my daughter. Many many thanks and hope to stay with you again.

For no doubt, Marina Bay Sand Hotel is not only one of the most famous hotels in the world, but also an iconic landmark of Singapore. The innovative design of the three extraordinary towers combined with the infinity long pool makes the hotel a very impressive architecture — a true futuristic theme which epitomizes Singapore’s modern elegance and sophistication. The magnificent pool which stands on the 57th floor is what the hotel known for. It’s renowned for the stunning and phenomenal views which your excitement has no end in sight. I started my day early morning there to enjoy the urban oasis of tranquility (for check-in guests only).

On the other hand, the prime location and the hotel amenities make Marina Bay Sand Hotel a perfect place for a vibrant city life and the legendary nightlife. The hotel is accessed to the lobby with all luxury shopping brands, a 24-hr casino, an exclusive nightclub and Bayfront MRT station — everything metropolitans call for.

The greenery Gardens by the Bay (my favorite place in Singapore— a sanctuary of the bustling part of the city), which is just right behind the hotel, is my another reason to stick with MBS. The observation deck and the roof bar in the hotel brought me mind-blowing experiences by overlooking some of Singapore’s most captivating views and the stunning light shows. They are just breathtaking and panoramic!

Back to square one, to stay or not to stay at Marina Bay Sand Hotel? The main reason for most visitors to choose this hotel is because of the most incredible swimming pool in the world and which makes everything worth. You can simply make your reservation for just a day and make a balance by having cheap eat or finger food since food in Singapore is mouthwatering! However, if you’re not a swimming person you can totally skip it. You can easily buy a ticket to the observation deck or enjoy drinks in the roof bar without spending a fortune.

Eminent_One,May 2024,A wonderful experience!,"We stayed at MBS for 4 nights to celebrate my husbands 50th birthday. We arrived mid morning and received a warm welcome. Our luggage was securely stored and we were given a pass for the pool so we could use it straight away. When our room was ready we were sent an email to let us know. We had a room overlooking the Gardens by the Bay and the Harbour, which was a spectacular view. The hotel sent up a birthday cake to our room, and we had another birthday cake when we ate at Lavo.

Every member of hotel staff greeted us warmly and the housekeeping is the best we've ever encountered. Every day our room was tidied including our cables being stowed away with MBS cable ties!

We had breakfast every morning at the roof top restaurant which was lovely. The food was good and the view outstanding.

The only slight niggle was when we went up late evening to the roof top bars for our last night and found it packed with non residents, meaning we had to queue to get a table. That said, when the staff recognised that we were residents we were seated more quickly than non residents. A minor frustration and to be expected in such a iconic hotel.

bpm_1,May 2024,The MBS is worth a trip,"First of all, many thanks to the VIP service and the concierge service staff, who looked after us wonderfully over the three days.
We were among those who suffered most from the storm in Dubai and had to spend our stay at the MBS WITHOUT our suitcases.

We have already visited many first-class hotels, but even a comparison with the ""Fairmont The Palm"" is not accurate. The MBS is in a class of its own, especially with the pool.

Although we only got to the pool in the afternoon, we got loungers right by the pool. The ""best"" is the pool in the evening. Wonderful, lying in the water and looking out over the city.
The service at the pool is a bit slow, but that's OK. We are on vacation and not on the run.

The room - we were on the 18th floor, with a balcony and a view of the ""metal forest"" - was also amazing.
The room furnishings, especially with the bathroom, which is a bit old but very well maintained, the bar and also the cocktails in the room, are good. But chairs with a small table on the balcony would not be a bad idea.

In the evening we ate at the Italian restaurant, Lavo, with a view over Singapore, woh. The food is very varied and of high quality. The service is also very good.

As we were only at the MBS for three nights, we were unable to visit the other restaurants, we only went to Blossom, which is also recommended.

During the day, the lobby resembles an anthill. It only gets quieter from around 10 p.m. This is also the time when you can visit the ""Renko Bar"" without stress and noise. Here too, the service is very good. We drank several of the cocktails, not bad.

But there is also one point of criticism concerning the breakfast.
The breakfast is generally extensive and very good, but for guests who don't eat hot food for breakfast, it is a bit one-sided. Three types of cheese/sausage can be described as very straightforward.

What is also missing, and this is part of the package (at least for us) in a hotel of this class, is free sparkling wine/prosecco with breakfast. But that's complaining at a high level.

Since we couldn't really enjoy the holiday because of the missing luggage - we were then in Bali from April 22nd to May 2nd and the luggage didn't arrive until April 27th - we will do the trip again next year.",4 of 5 bubbles,April 2024,Traveled as a couple,"Erkrath, Germany",en,The MBS is worth a trip,error,"First of all, many thanks to the VIP service and the concierge service staff, who looked after us wonderfully over the three days.

I will definitely go back and stay there again ."
Josephliyen,May 2024,"Great location, hard products, but the arrival experience was terrible","Leaving Malaysia early in the morning, we arrived in Changi airport around 9am, and through the MRT, got to Marina Bay Sands Hotel's check in counter around 11am. Knowing that we were going to arrive early, we sent an email to the hotel a week early to see if there would be any opportunity for an early check-in. In the response, they mentioned the possibility subject to availability.

Upon arriving at the check-in desk at Tower 1, the atmosphere was quite a contrast from the friendly possibility conveyed in the email response. It first took us about 10 minutes of waiting, until someone approached us at the line. Before even looking at our booking, he told us promptly that check-in is not available until 3pm. I mentioned about the email corresspondence, and that is when he reluctantly took my reservation number, then told us to head down to Tower 3 and enquire there, since we would be staying at Tower 3. He also then said there will be a charge for early check-in if it is available.

When we got to Tower 3, the check-in counter had 2 people on staff. One was helping a customer while the other stood there and looked at the other person, walking back and forth. Including us, there were 4 more sets of guests waiting in line. It took 30 minutes, I'm not exaggerating here, until that person that was doing nothing, acknowledge the guests in front of us in the line to go talk to him. Then another staff waved us down to go to the check-out counter to help us. The first couple was still standing at the counter, 30 minutes after, talking to the first staff. While we were waiting, the 4 of us in line started talking about how this extreme wait in line seemed to be a tactic from the hotel to discourage anyone to attempt to have an early check-in. To be honest, all I wanted to do at that point was to drop off my luggages for storage so we could be on our way.

At the Check-out counter, the lady kindly let us know it's because it is around their check out time of 11am, so they are mostly busy with checking the guests out. After some discussions, she advises us that if the room is ready before 3pm for early check-in, they will send us an email. She then proceeds to tell us in great details of
all the fine-dining restaurants the hotel has to offer, including their multiple signature dishes from each restaurant. I then realized why it took so long for the preivouis guests. We wanted to get out of the hotel to go enjoy our day, so we wanted to leave. She then further informed us that there are renovations going on at Tower 3, and we are on the lower level. While the renovation is on the higher levels, we may still hear noises. I then asked if we could be moved to either Tower 1 or 2 to avoid the noises, she responded that our rate would not allow us to be in the nicer, newly renovated rooms of Tower 1 or 2, but she will do her best to give us the best room in the category in Tower 3. Considering the rate of booking this hotel was just shy of $1,000 SGD, I really didn't like hearing this information. Not only did MBS not inform us through email communication prior to our arrival, but the way the lady informed us the situation made us felt like we were some sort of poor guests that should've spend more to avoid noise inconvenience. We left the hotel a bit miffed, and went about our day. We were given temporary keys so we could access the rooftop pool, one of the main highlights of the hotel. We spent about an hour there before we left. It was nice, had a great view of the city, although a bit hot and smog. After the pool we went about our day.

We got the email notification that the room was ready at exactly 2:58pm. Once we checked into our room, my previous frustration with the frontline staff pretty much went away. The room was gorgeously appointed. The view to the Garden By The Bay (GBTB) was beautiful. The room itself was quite large, and the bathroom was
marbled throughout, nothing sort of a luxury hotel, and easily rivaled the Ritz or JW of the Marriott brands. The entire minibar was free as well. Shortly after our check-in, a gentleman arrived to provide some turndown service. He was quite eager to help, and provided us multiple bags of chips and more coffee and drinks.
I visited the pool at night for the second time, and this time I felt the magic of this rooftop infinity pool truly came alive. The lighting of the pool was a beautiful hue of turquoise. By now the city is lit up, the temperature dropped a bit, and people are clubbing in one of the rooftop bar with great music. Generally it had a great vibe. The view at night is nothing short of magical, and the pool wasn't very busy either so I never felt crowded. I ended up staying in the pool until it closed at midnight. This was one of the highlights of my Singapore visit.

The night view of GBTB from our room was even more beautiful than during the day. I took the opportunity and walked around the hotel, and all the way towards GBTB, pass 1am, and took in all its amazing architecture. This hotel is definitely an architectural and engineering masterpiece.

In the morning, the gentleman from the evening turndown service returned to offer more tea. I asked for his name this time. Chang Cheng was very courteous and we really appreciated his attententiveness during our stay.

Although we were offered a discount at their Rise restaurant for breakfast, we decided to go to the casino solely to have a lobster laksa noodle soup from the restaurant within. It was delicious. I also browsed the gift shop situated within the hotel, and bought a book that talked about how the MBS hotel was built.

Throughout our stay, we didn't hear the noise from renovation at all. And upon our check out, the frontline staff graciously offered us a 1-hour late check-out without any hesitation, which we really appreciated. As we called our grab to leave the hotel, the bell service staff checked our Grab details, invited us to wait inside the air-conditioned space, then queued us to head out as our Grab arrived, which we also very much appreciated their care in the service.

Overall I was quite satisfied from this stay, minus the initial impression during the arrival process. I recognize the staff warned us about the renovation noise to temper expectation, but perhaps the delivery could be better, and really don't let your guests wait in line for more than 10 minutes if possible.

From the moment we arrived at Marina Bay Sands, we were immersed in an atmosphere of sheer luxury and unparalleled service. Our check-in experience was seamless, and we were thrilled to discover that we had been upgraded to a stunning suite on one of the higher floors, offering breathtaking panoramic views of the city skyline and Marina Bay.

The suite was nothing short of extraordinary. It featured elegant, modern decor with expansive windows that allowed us to soak in the iconic views at any time of the day. The plush king-sized bed provided the utmost comfort, while the spacious living area and well-appointed bathroom with a deep soaking jacuzzi tub added to the overall opulence of our stay. The attention to detail was evident, from the high-end toiletries to the complimentary Nespresso coffee machine and a well-stocked minibar.

Of course, no visit to Marina Bay Sands would be complete without experiencing the world-renowned Infinity Pool. Floating on the edge of this architectural marvel, with the glittering cityscape stretching out before us, was truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience. The pool area was impeccably maintained, and the poolside service was prompt and courteous.

Exploring the integrated resort was a delight, from the high-end shops at The Shoppes to the fascinating ArtScience Museum. The location is perfect for exploring Singapore, with major attractions just a short distance away.

Our stay at Marina Bay Sands was an unforgettable experience, made even more special by the upgrade to a suite and the exceptional service we received throughout. This hotel truly sets the standard for luxury and hospitality, and we can't wait to return for another extraordinary stay.

Melanie,May 2024,Great pool and view - but it is enough to stay there once - much too expensive,"We also had a stopover at the Marina Bay Sands. Like so many others, we wanted to spend the night here and experience the pool for ourselves. The staff were all very friendly - you can use the pool even before you get the official room key. Which is what we did. You can leave your suitcases at reception. We were lucky here and found a spot by the pool without any problems. However, there is no shade or parasols here, which bothered us a bit and we didn't want to get sunburnt on the first day of our vacation. Due to the construction site in Tower 3, we were upgraded to a suite and moved to Tower 2. We were very happy about the upgrade, although we are sure that the deluxe room would have been very nice too.
The hotel and pool are of course great and definitely worth a visit if you have never been there before. Personally, however, I think that staying there once is enough. The room prices are excessive and I would not be willing to spend that much money again. Next time we are in Singapore, we will look for another hotel. But to have been there once in your life was worth it. And I think that is ultimately what the hotel and its pricing policy are aiming for. You don't get to use the pool without staying overnight, and many people want to do that once in their life, which is why they can charge these prices. The hotel itself is friendly, but you have to be aware that you are just one guest among many. The hotel is simply far too big for that.  
What really bothered us was the rooftop bar CÉ LA VI. We wanted to have a drink/cocktail there in the evening. When you go there, the receptionist first checks whether you are even allowed in or whether your clothing is appropriate. Then you go in and just stand there lost. No member of staff looked after us. The music was also far too loud, so you couldn't or didn't want to sit inside. There are very few tables outside, some of them are cordoned off, and you don't really know where you are allowed or should go. We then simply left again - but here too the lady at the entrance was not surprised why we left more or less immediately. We had the feeling that we were not wanted here. The tables here are probably reserved for guests who eat in the restaurant beforehand, which not everyone can or wants to afford. We have seen much better rooftop bars in other 5* hotels in other big cities (e.g. Bangkok).",5 of 5 bubbles,April 2024,Traveled as a couple,"Islikon, Switzerland",en,Great pool and view - but it is enough to stay there once - much too expensive,error,"We also had a stopover at the Marina Bay Sands.

We were very happy about the upgrade, although we are sure that the deluxe room would have been very nice too.
The hotel and pool are of course great and definitely worth a visit if you have never been there before. Personally, however, I think that staying there once is enough. The room prices are excessive and I would not be willing to spend that much money again. Next time we are in Singapore, we will look for another hotel. But to have been there once in your life was worth it. And I think that is ultimately what the hotel and its pricing policy are aiming for. You don't get to use the pool without staying overnight, and many people want to do that once in their life, which is why they can charge these prices. The hotel itself is friendly, but you have to be aware that you are just one guest among many. The hotel is simply far too big for that.  
What really bothered us was the rooftop bar CÉ LA VI. We wanted to have a drink/cocktail there in the evening. When you go there, the receptionist first checks whether you are even allowed in or whether your clothing is appropriate. Then you go in and just stand there lost. No member of staff looked after us. The music was also far too loud, so you couldn't or didn't want to sit inside. There are very few tables outside, some of them are cordoned off, and you don't really know where you are allowed or should go. We then simply left again - but here too the lady at the entrance was not surprised why we left more or less immediately. We had the feeling that we were not wanted here. The tables here are probably reserved for guests who eat in the restaurant beforehand, which not everyone can or wants to afford. We have seen much better rooftop bars in other 5* hotels in other big cities (e.g. Bangkok)."

Tanameraboy,May 2024,"Not the experience I expected, so I checked out a night earlier","I had a free 3-night stay in the deluxe Paiza room in Tower 2 which according to the hotel cost SGD 1,360+ per room night. Although the view from the room, the interior design of the room and room amenities were fantastic, guest service left much to be desired and the everywhere I went was so packed with people wanting bragging rights. Why was guest service not up to par for a high end luxury hotel?
1. The gym was located in a different building and I needed to walk through the shopping mall (The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands) among crowd.
2. I went to the front desk next to the concierge to ask for directions to the gym only to be told by the upstart that he wasn’t the concierge. I scolded him to go ask the concierge who was 10 metres away and on the same counter.
3. When I asked housekeeping to refill the coffee capsules for my Nespresso, she said it wasn’t her department and i had to dial “express service”.
4. I had to wait 10 minutes before I got through “express service”, and the person on the other end couldn’t understand English.
5. The breakfast place was so packed, even the “exclusive” Renku Club ran out of seating, so much so that the wait staff had trouble remembering my fresh juice.
6. The pool on the 57th floor, despite being for guests only, was crowded with guests taking photos for bragging rights.

july_in_south_africa,May 2024,Stunning stay at MBS,"Fantastic 3 night stay. MBS is a stunning flagship for modern Singapore.
Our suite was exquisite. Huge, spotlessly clean, gorgeous design & great view of the bay, gardens and super trees music and light show. We didn't want to leave!
Particular thanks to Hill, on reception: she was brilliant. Professional, friendly and helpful and she made our stay extra-special. Thank you.
We stayed on 42nd floor, Tower 2, with a separate entrance and lifts to our room. Access to the pool was easy at any time. Our butler(!) reserved a pool cabana - just let them know when you'd like one.
Breakfast at Spago was relaxed and delicious, and we appreciated the afternoon tea and early evening champagne at Renku.
We loved sunrise sound meditation on the rooftop observation deck - an unforgettable experience. If you're there on a Tuesday or Thursday, I highly recommend it. There's no charge for guests but you must book in advance, or can pay to attend if you're staying elsewhere.
Overall, an an amazing stay.
The only things we'd change:
- 1 breakfast we chose to have at Rise. The choice of food was great, but it was more family-oriented, very noisy and busy.
- the tech in our suite was glitchy. Couldn't change volume on TV or turn it off. iPads didn't actually control anything, just showed the settings. I'm sure they would have sorted it if we'd asked, but we were enjoying the hotel too much to bother :)",5 of 5 bubbles,April 2024,Traveled as a couple,"Richmond-upon-Thames, United Kingdom",en,Stunning stay at MBS,error,"Fantastic 3 night stay.

Gregoire d,May 2024,"A journey inward, through sound, on top of Singapore!","Taking part in the Sound Bath Meditation led by Karu, is an experience you should not miss if you are staying at MBS or wanting to slow down in Sunny Singapore.

It starts with a beautiful sunrise on the sky deck of the 56th floor at 7:30am. You are greeted by a warm and friendly team in a breathtaking space where the city and the sea surround you, almost as if you are on a mountain top. As the facilitator warms up with his array of instruments, you find comfort on a mat that is provided for you (with water and a towel). A safe space to be held for everyone, Karu invites you to arrive, as yourself and fully present. It is not only a journey through the sounds which not only allow you to tune in to yourself but the pure joy of immersing in the auditory experience. This is not my first sound bath meditation with Karu, and I love how each time there is something for you to take home. The message today: You are responsible for your thoughts and feelings and it is important to accept and understand them first, before taking hold of them . ‘Do not outsource your happiness’.

This is a great activity to go alone or with your loved ones. No two activity is the same and I encourage you to try it out and see what it may bring you.

Thank you.

Wei Bing L,May 2024,Impressive Service and Facilities! A Once-in-a-Lifetime Experience!,"My Uncle & I visited Singapore on a 2-day stop-over, on our way to Siem Reap, Cambodia. My Uncle hasn't been to Singapore in over 30 years, so I decided to stay splurge and stay for 2 nights at the most iconic hotel in Singapore. We arrived at the hotel by taxi from Changi airport at around 11.30am. The doormen helped us to take our luggage from the trunk of our taxi the minute our taxi pulled up at the front entrance of Tower 1. We were then escorted to the check-in counter and there wasn't any queue at all that morning! While we were in the process of checking in, a friendly staff member came around to offer all the arriving guests complimentary bottles of drinking water and Chuppa-chupps lollipops(a popular candy in Asia)! I have traveled around the world, never before has any hotel or resort ever offered their new guests Chuppa-chupps candy!!! As per our booking, we were allocated a twin-bed room on a high floor with a view of the Gardens by the Bay. The check-in process was completed in 7-minutes and our room was ready right away! No need to wait until 3pm like some other previous guests had lamented.

The room was magnificent, clean, comfortable and spacious, with all the amenities you would expect from a 5-star hotel, plus breathtaking views from the ENORMOUS balcony! This was the first time that we have seen a sofa set(a 3-seater & 2 single seaters) on a hotel room balcony!!! The room also included complimentary mini bar drinks and snacks, which will be replenished once a day during the housekeeping service. We could also request for additional bottles of drinking water, which we did, because we spent a fair bit of time walking around Singapore and the weather here is hot & humid.

The world-famous infinity edge swimming pool is as spectacular as all the photos on social media has portrayed! We were fortunate that on the day we took a dip in the iconic swimming pool, it wasn't overcrowded and we managed to get some great photos from this facility. Guests will be given 2 pool towels & a bottle of drinking water upon registering to enter the pool. IMPORTANT NOTE: Each guest has to hold 1 individual key card which was issued by the check-in counter upon checking into the hotel, in order to be allowed to enter and use the swimming pool. If you are a couple who are traveling together, both of you have to produce an in-house hotel room key card each, in order to enter the pool. The management has to be very stringent with everyone who wants to enter the swimming pool because in the past, some outsiders have tried various ways to sneak into the iconic swimming pool.

The famous botanical garden called Gardens By the Bay is connected to this hotel. We took a stroll to the Super Tree Grove to take some photos but we didn't enter the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome.

There is also a huge shopping mall with plenty of restaurants and a big food court featuring local delicacies, connected to this impressive hotel. The MRT station called Marina Bay is located in the basement of this hotel, enabling all visitors easy access to the very efficient and well-connected public transport network of Singapore.

The only drawback is: our room rates didn't include any complimentary breakfast despite our room costing USD850 per night! However, we did have dinner at RISE, the buffet restaurant located in the lobby of the ground floor of Tower 1, at our own expense and it was amazing! All-you-can-eat boiled Boston lobsters and Alaskan King Crab legs, plus a huge variety of Asian and Western dishes! The ice creams with local flavours were truly delicious! If you are staying at this hotel, you definitely should try the buffet dinner at RISE. The concierge can help you to make reservations for this restaurant the minute you check-in.

Tracey,Apr 2024,"Amazing, Immersive Experience in Singapore","I’ve done sound meditation before but not at this level. Karu was amazing, he took time to connect with me as an individual. The rich variety of sound, variations of volume, and intensity really moved something within me.

After the session I felt relaxed and balanced, in ‘tune’ with my body and soul, cleansed and renewed, ready to face anything that life will throw at me.

The venue was perfect, I really look forward to attending another session.

If you are new to Sound Meditiaion, experienced or just want an experience like no other then I would thoroughly recommend this class.

JuRut,Apr 2024,"The pool is the star, the rest is average at best","The hotelroom was decent, not spectacular.
We were on a very low floor (the 4th) although we had paid top dollar.
So there was no view, but also a very noisy environment in the corridor as hundreds of tourists pass the lobby just below the 4th floor, in one single open space.
(Our previous Singapore hotel oozed peace & quiet in the corridors, causing people to whisper.....not at Marina Bay Sands; it sounded more like a mall).

The balcony is ultra narrow, an obese person could not stand there with closed balcony doors.

2 problems in the room:
- A leaking toilet, which was fixed.
- A complete power cut at 01:00AM, which was also fixed by a technician.

sarahu1981,Apr 2024,"Wow wow wow, this is THE place to stay","Wow (and a lot of other wows) is how I would describe MBS. From the minute I walked in the door I received amazing service. I was taken in to a special room to complete the checkin process. My room was not ready (to be expected as I was checking it early to make the most of the facilities). Sheila was absolutely lovely and so friendly. The process was seamless and I received a temporary card so I could use the pool. I asked to receive an email when my room was ready (which I did receive in the afternoon). I was also asked if I specially wanted a twin room (which I had booked) and I said that I didn’t mind what room I had.

I headed straight up to the infinity pool and spent the day there. I luckily managed to snag a cabana seat in the adults only area. The pool (the bucket list reason for me wanting to stay at MBS) was amazing. The water was so nice and refreshing. Ordered a couple of cocktails and lunch by the pool. Not cheap, but it was nice to be able to relax.
Once I received an email to say that my room was ready I went back to the front desk to collect my room key. I was very excited to hear that I had been upgraded to a newly renovated king suite. It was the nicest hotel room I have ever stayed in. The bed was gigantic. Same with the TV. The bathroom was palatial and so well appointed. They even had Jo Malone shampoo, conditioner, body wash and lotion.
When I made my booking I also said that I was celebrating my birthday and I was blown away when I had a knock at the door, with the hotel delivering me a birthday cake.
After dinner in the MBS Mall, I returned to the pool. It was amazing to see Singapore lit up and night. Make sure you spend time in both the pool and the spa, as you can see Gardens by the Bay lit up from the spa.

Coddy A,Apr 2024,Chinese New Year 2024 year of the Wooden Dragon.,"Photographs well. Experience is something different. Let’s start with the obvious. This is a massive hotel with a cool rooftop. For a few nights in heart of everything tourists come to see, this is the place. We also must note, we stayed during Chinese lunar new year. Crowds were well above normal we were told. However, we came back a few weeks later. While the crowd was less horrendous, it was still very crowded

It’s very pricey and for what you get, which is a high volume theme park like queues everywhere you go. We felt more like cattle moving through a space. The mass of hotel guests and visitors means, a hotel guest has few to no options for restaurants as they are all always fully booked out. As others have mentioned, sizable minimums apply (the restaurant which did have availability had a $300 minimum per person, and a table was not guaranteed). At this restaurant, the hostess tugged at my sleeve to inform me of minimum, dress code, and other rules.

In other restaurants, they also charge for everything. Tap water - there’s a charge. A wet nap which they provided, there was a charge.

The staff is friendly enough, but not much in the way of service, more like moving people through. We sat at a restaurant for about fifteen minutes waiting for a server to take our order. A manager came by, pointed and tapped at her watch and said we needed to order as they were about to take the last order of the evening. We explained then she might want to have her server come by, or take the order herself.

The good, The bad and the ugly.

What we do like about this hotel is its location and views which can’t be beat. The photo op ready pool deck. Beware, like many similar travel photos, the pictures outshine the actual subject, but the day we spent poolside was worth it. We also had an incredible welcome by the transportation department at Changi the airport. The driver was great, and our check in experience was in room and very personal. The ability to connect with Guest Services at anytime through what’s app texting was great. A feature we like.

The rooms are dated, dirty carpets and paint coming off the walls like old Vegas style at least the room in the tower we got.

Housekeeping was excellent.

The Spago restaurant for breakfast, lunch, drinks and pool service. Was great. Excellent staff and management.

You are also deceptively close to the Gardens by the Bay, Marina Bay, and shopping. Unfortunately, due to how the hotel is designed, and security continually blocking entrances and exits (no reasons given) you often need to leave the hotel, circumnavigate the building (remember it’s huge), then find your way to the MRT tunnel to get to Gardens of the Bay. We once ended up in the shopping mall across the street, and could not find an entrance which let us back into the hotel. Literally one sign pointed in one direction to the hotel, only to walk about 50 meters to see another sign pointing us back in the direction we just came.

For us, this was a one and done. Maybe a person preference - too big, too crowded, too difficult.

MoonsterUK,Apr 2024,Wow wow wow,"We stayed in the new sands premier suite and wow this room is stunning. These rooms have recently been revamped and they do feel so fresh and modern. The bed is luxuriously comfortable and huge. The television is ginormous. The bathroom has a shower that is big enough for a small family, a Japanese toilet, a full size bath and dual sinks with all the bathroom amenities you could think about needing. The dressing room has more storage than I have ever seen in a hotel room before. The lounge area can be converted into a sofa bed but note this is not particularly big. It was just about big enough for skinny 6 and 8 year olds, two older occupants would have required lots of snuggling. Plenty of water, chocolates and tea and coffee provided. We had two balconies overlooing the gardens and could watch the SuperTree Rhapsody from here. It wasn't wide enough for balcony furniture but I think this will depend on what level you get, lower down the balconies are wider but higher up there is a better view. City view there are no balconies. The room attendant did a thorough job each day and even coiled up or the wires for your electronics for you!

Clearly people stay here to use the pool, and it is stunning. There were plenty of loungers when we were there. It is surprisingly not that warm a pool, particularly when it has been overcast. Drinks by the pool come with the expected pricetag (one alcoholic and one non-alcoholic cocktail was almost 50 SGD (£29). Pool is only accessible to hotel guests; no cabana rental and I'd be surprised if people can ""break in"". There are staff at the entrance scanning keys and every person has to have a key, even children. So you can't book a room for 2 and 6 people enter the pool. Of course, this exclusivity means it is not too busy for guests. We watched the Spectra show from the pool, which I'd recommend. Pool was open 6am until midnight. Plenty of towels available. We had robes in our room which we wore to the pool.

Breakfasts is plentiful and delicious. So many options to chose from - western, Asian, Japanese.

Obviously the location is prime. We walked to gardens by the bay. Merlion park is around 20-30 mimutes walk taking in the helix bridge and the hawker market at Te La Pau is a similar distance. The airport was around 20 minutes in a taxi (which cost about 26-30 SGD) and the zoo is around 35 minutes drive. There is an MRT under the shopping centre but we did not use it.

We were well looked after by the premium team. Every member of staff we engaged with in the hotel (including club lounge, rise restaurant, pool, sands lifestyle team, front door team) was courteous and charming. In particular the staff at the tower 1 doors who would spontaneously offer tips on Singapore (I think one was called Mr Lo - he proudly was telling me of his son who is a medical student but also gave us several other tips), our wonderful happy limo driver and Arabella who assisted us as the airport. All the staff are an asset to this hotel and if you chose to engage with them, they will ensure you have a wonderful experience in Singapore.

We really hope to be able to come back, but for now, my children are so happy that they got to swim in the ""Mariokart pool"" - anyone who has raced Singapore Speedway on Mariokart will understand.",5 of 5 bubbles,April 2024,Traveled with family,UK,error,Wow wow wow,error,"We stayed in the new sands premier suite and wow this room is stunning.

Christian,Apr 2024,A truly fantastic hotel!,"My wife and I stayed at Marina Bay Sands for a part of our honeymoon and loved it. We cannot recommend this hotel enough. Prior to booking, we looked at a variety of hotels in Singapore and thought we would go with the hype of Marina Bay and it was definitely the best decision.

Where do I start? When we arrived at the hotel, the staff were so attentive. We were told at check-in that we were given a free upgrade to the Butler Suite. It was unbelievable! It wasn't just the room (which was incredible), we received all of the benefits alongside it. For example, afternoon tea with drinks (alcoholic if wanted) and food from 2:30-4:30, then more free food and drink 4:30-6:30pm with the late afternoon canapes. The food consisted of huge prawns, crab, lamb etc. As well as this, we had our reserved cabana every day which came with unlimited soft drinks and one alcoholic drink. This is just a couple of things that the Butler Suite came with and honestly, this gesture from the hotel just made a lovely ending to our honeymoon trip.

We stayed 4 nights in this luxury and didn't want to leave.

We live in Dubai and have experienced a number of amazing hotels but what we received at Marina Bay was on another level.

The breakfast had everything you could think of and catered for a variety of cultures. The 1 minute walk to the Marina Bay gardens which was beautiful was great. The tall iconic infinity pool was stunning and has an adult only section too as the huge pool is split into three sections. The staff from arrival to when we left were phenomenal.

Our butlers - Danial and Vince. I have to say, we were so lucky to have these two look after us on our whole stay at Marina Bay. They made our stay that bit more special that it already was. They both would pick us up from the gym and guide us to our tables and one thing which I will remember is that we asked Danial to recommend some restaurants to visit for dinner in the morning. By lunchtime, Danial had printed out a booklet (that he made by himself) with his top restaurant suggestions. It stated how many if there were few seats left as well as other specific details which I thought was just a lovely touch. Honestly, both Danial and Vince's service was impeccable and Marina Bay are very lucky to have two hardworking and attentive employees such as yourselves.

There is so many other elements that were great about Marina Bay. A hotel and package I would and will recommend to others.

Having watched the TV programme on this hotel which portrayed how caring the management was I am completely disappointed in their response I understand work has to be done but in woorking hours not at 4 pm on a Saturday afternoon."
Chris M,Apr 2024,Marina Bay Sands is a bucket-list Luxury Hotel with simply breathtaking views and incredible service.,"Marina Bay Sands is a bucket-list Luxury Hotel with simply breathtaking views and incredible service.

Having booked four rooms for our Family, I would say that from the very start, everything was a breeze and nothing was ever too much trouble.
The interaction via email and phone during the booking process with the staff was smooth and attentive.

Upon arrival, one of our family members was greeted by Apriel from the 'Premium Services' team and from there on in, the service provided during our stay to the entire family by Apriel (mainly) along with her colleague Shataz both in person and via the WhatsApp service they prodive during the stay, was just exceptional and first class.

The Hotel overall was as hoped :)
It was for our Mother's 70th and the attention to detail they went to and having a Birthday Cake delivered to her room on the day made it that much more special.

The 'Gardens by the Bay View' rooms were very luxurious, very well appointed, beautifully laid out & styled, very comfortable and had stunning views across Gardens By the Bay and beyond.
The 'Family Suite' that we had also organised, I've not seen such a well laid out and designed Family Room which had a double-bunk for the kids, seperate TV & Nintendo Switch along with thoughful gift packs upon arrival. This was all in a self contained part of the suite.

The roof-top infinity pool naturally is the draw card i'd say for nearly everyone. Early morning or late evening swims allowed for lesser crowds and great photo opps with generous open / close times. It spands across nearly the entire roof-top which allows for quiet parts to find and enjoy the moment / view / swim.

You have an abundance of choise for food, drinks, breakfast locations (both on the roof-top pool and ground level) at Spargo or Rice along with multiple bars and resturants throughout.
LAVO which is an Italian themed restaurant on the roof-top also is worth dining at.
The underneath walk-thru connecting you to 'The Shoppes' complex entirely is a nice way to wander through the warmer parts of the day and so easy to move around.

As mentioned at the start, it is a Bucket-list Luxury Hotel
which is on such an extreme scale (size wise) that you can feel quite overwhelmed in trying to take it all in and see everything it has to offer.

The service provided though by Apriel and the team are what made this Hotel such an enjoyable experience and one we won't forget. Thank you also to the initial bookings team and cleaning staff for our rooms who did a terrific job on every day of our stay.",5 of 5 bubbles,March 2024,Traveled with family,"Melbourne, Australia",error,Marina Bay Sands is a bucket-list Luxury Hotel with simply breathtaking views and incredible service.,error,"Marina Bay Sands is a bucket-list Luxury Hotel with simply breathtaking views and incredible service.

Max Lavelle,Apr 2024,"An experience, not a hotel","If you want the best views of Singapore (minus the view of the MBS itself), look no further than here. Upon arrival we were kindly upgraded by KC to a (smoking although we don’t smoke) stunning suite with excellent views of Singapore city centre. The room was, as I say, stunning - Faultless in fact aside from the slightly too wintery bedding for the climate.

Breakfast downstairs (can’t recall the name) was included and was faultless - Upstairs at Spago was a little more lacklustre but still fine.

The reason I call this an experience is all the people who simply visit the MBS to visit it - From the lobby which is like a shopping centre to the rooftop pool which is a bit of a joke with others paying to enter. I get the economics of it, but as a guest of the hotel, it doesn’t actually feel like you’re an exclusive guest.

mirrorlessadventures,Apr 2024,Mostly Disappointing with Very Few Sparks of Excellence. Inconsistency is Their Only Consistency.,"Maybe we were spoiled from our prior stays at Amansara and Capella right before checking into MBS. but the hotel left a lot to be desired.

We stayed 3 nights at the Paiza Signature Suite. Originally we had booked the Paiza Premiere Suite, but due to the number of people, we wanted to have at least an additional powder room. So we decided to inquire about an upgrade upon arrival. And things started going south from right then (see CONS section below).

But before I begin with the longer list of things that could have been better, I would just like to mention the highlights of our stay.

>>PROS

1. Ivan Teng, our limo driver was AMAZING!!! He alone deserves 10 stars and is the reason I gave 3 stars. We requested a limo for 4 hours on our second day to tour the city and were lucky enough to be assigned to Ivan. We basically gave the hotel a list of places we wanted to visit, and requested we stop whenever we wanted to get off the limo and walk around. Ivan was not only accommodating, but when we got hungry, he gave us lunch spot recommendations (one of the best meals we had in Singapore!), basically gave us a tour by explaining the buildings, neighborhoods, etc., was super funny and easy to talk to, and when we went to get some fruits at a local market, and had forgotten to get Singapore Dollars (we only had US dollars), he came to the rescue. I cannot say enough praises about Ivan. Although our stay was far from amazing, Ivan alone is enough to make me consider a return to MBS (but then I was told we are not able to request specific limo drivers).

2. Jeffrey Lim, another limo driver. The best department at MBS must be their limo drivers, because most of them were amazing. But Jeffrey Lim, whom we had only a brief 15 minute ride with, was so friendly and courteous. He was like a breath of fresh air. For some reason, about 90% of the staff at MBS did not introduce themselves by name (which most staff members at high end resorts/hotels do). Jeffrey not only introduced himself the moment we got in the car, but was very accommodating.

3. Win, housekeeping team. Now most of everything at MBS was incredibly slow (will mention below). But Win was anything but. He showed up the moment we requested anything, and understood our needs right away. So, thank you.

4. Serena, one of the butlers. We met Serena on the second day of our stay. Our stay in general was quite disappointing as the title mentions, and as will be explained below. However, Serena tried her best to amend things, which I really appreciated. Also, after our check out, we discovered one of our companion's wallet was missing, and we had to go back to the hotel. Serena was more than accommodating in getting a search going at the hotel. We did find it somewhere else later, but Serena and the staff's help was much appreciated.

5. Soo, one of the managers at Paiza Sky Residence. Paiza Sky Residence had opened the day prior to our departure, and they had only just officially opened, so it is more than understandable that things are being worked out, one of those things was missing a decaf option for coffee. Upon merely suggesting that it may be a good option to have for the future, Soo made it happen right away.

6. Xander, one of the butlers gave us a really authentic recommendation for a local fruit stand.

7. As everyone knows, the hotel has inside it, or is connected to many attractions--Gardens by the Bay, Shoppes, Casino, etc--you basically won't even have to leave the complex to make it a vacation.

8. We actually had some very smelly food during one of the stays. We ate it on the balcony, and requested plastic wraps when disposing of it, and since we already had air purifiers in the room (see below), we made good use of them. But we really appreciated the staff for accommodating this.

And the pros pretty much end there.

>>CONS
1. The Check-in process took 90+ minutes. We did request an upgrade, and the hotel had to check the availability. So taking slightly more than usual is definitely understandable. But I mean, OVER 90 minutes...? Upon requesting an upgrade to a room with a bathroom and a powder room, and explaining that we needed two toilets, the staff member who helped us check in just did not understand my request and kept asking me if I needed two bathrooms. I had to explain the request to the staff member about 4 times.

It took about an hour JUST to figure out if there was a room available and to give us a quote on the new price. And upon agreeing to the price, took another 30 minutes of us standing at the check-in desk to secure the room.

2. We were not told about the Paiza Check-in desk. Although we had from the initial reservation, booked a Paiza Suite, we were not told about the Paize Check-in section. Our 90+ minutes would have been very much easier to bear if we had known.

3. While the room was getting ready, we were shown to Renku, the lounge. We ordered Coke, Peppermint Tea, and water. You can imagine how tired and thirsty we might have been after the long stressful check-in process. One of my companions had actually flown in that morning and was just dying to relax. Imagine my frustration when the peppermint tea and even the WATER took 25 minutes to arrive.

After more waiting... for our butler, we just could not stand it anymore and requested we just walk to the room ourselves.

Now the Paiza Signature room comes at OVER 6000 SGD a night. Yes, you read that right. three 0's. So imagine my surprise when...

4. ...we got into the room, we found no welcome fruit or cookies/snacks other than the regular complimentary food. We only received them when we called to ask about it (""hey... so do you guys usually do any welcome fruits?"").

And you know how high end hotels usually restock the welcome fruit daily? MBS did not. One day they didn't, the other day they did... inconsistent.

5. ...there was hair in the corner of the bathroom. Despite them telling us that do deep cleaning after every guest. I was just so tired of everything at this point, I didn't really bother to do much about it. But again, at this price point... and having mentioned a deep cleaning after every guest?

6. ...the room smelled of chemical--probably from the deep cleaning. However, at the price point, I would expect them to have figured the smell out. We had to basically run an air purifier and an ionizer during the entire stay.

7. ...there was a strong smell of cigarettes in the hallway. We had requested a non-smoking room. But I guess they do not group the room types together. Walking out of the room was unpleasant every single time. At least the smell didn't seep into the room.

8. ...one of the 2 iPads used to control the room did not work. I did let them know and they offered to fix it. But the timing was off and the engineer came when we were in the room so we just told them we'd use the other iPad. I'm starting to sound like a broken record, but at the price point... I would expect things to be working at tip top shape from the get-go.

9. ...the light along the curtain, when turned off, makes a ticking noise. This kept me up for hours until the light cooled down and stopped making the noise. I figured there was nothing the staff could do about this, so I did not mention this part.

10. ...we had to use no less than 2 bath towels to stop the flood from the shower every time we used it. So I read in an article, that the hotel purposefully left a gap on the bottom of the door to the shower so that the mat wouldn't get caught. Now don't get me wrong, the shower is one of the most gorgeous and beautiful parts of the room. However, I feel like if they were smart, they would have added a threshold the height of a mat rather than just leaving a gap where the water would just flood out. It didn't help that everything was marble and VERY slippery when wet (beautiful to look at, but dangerous nonetheless). Also didn't mention this to the staff because again, it's part of the design of the room.

11. During our stay, we requested that we get a seat at Lavo, their rooftop bar. We specifically requested the al fresco high table right next to the kid's pool. We also mentioned that the reservation would be UNNECESSARY if those specific seats were not available. We were told the butler team was able to secure a reservation at 10pm of the requested day. We actually worked the night's schedule around this reservation. So imagine, again, my disappointment, when we were shown to an indoor table. This was one of a number of miscommunications within the staff it seemed.

12. We ordered the fruit platter the same night as 11 above, and requested that we get as much tropical fruits as possible if available. We waited over 60 minutes, but had not gotten the fruits. When inquired, they just told us that there was some kind of a miscommunication. The butler team did give us an extra plate of fruit as a token of apology.

13. Check out process wasn't the smoothest. So we did mention most of our concerns to one of the managers at the hotel. And the butler team gave us some gifts (candle, musical toy, faux leather tray) and the management was gracious enough to promise us a discount of about 16% (which we had in writing via text). However, upon checkout, when we got the bill, the marked discount was 12%. When inquired, we were told this was the first time the staff member had heard about it. The staff member had to go back, check with her team, and came back with the new bill. Although the discount was MUCH appreciated, it was unfortunate that even the check out process wasn't as smooth as it could have been.

And below are not necessarily cons, but just small things the hotel could maybe work on to become a high(er) end hotel:

1. It would be great if the staff all introduced themselves and also remembered our names correctly. I was referred to by the wrong name about 3 to 4 different times by the butler team.

2. While dining at Paiza Sky Residence, which had opened the previous day, one of the servers actually took one of my companion's napkin away in the middle of the meal. I feel like the staff member was trying to freshen up the napkin when we actually put in an additional order, and the staff member walked away to put in the order. But I've actually never seen this happen anywhere else so it was a bit humorous.

3. As mentioned above we were not told of the Paiza Check In counter. Ever. Not only when checking in, but even during our stay. I just feel like this is something that guests need to be at least informed of when any one of the staff at the hotel realizes a guest is staying at one of the Paiza rooms. There were a few other services and details that could have used mentioning/explaining.

All in all, unfortunately, MBS was sorely disappointing...especially for what we paid. Mostly service and communication, and I'd say even the quality of the breakfast spread left quite a lot to be desired. It would be nice to not need a discount or multiple apologies, and rather have had been delivered the expected experience.",3 of 5 bubbles,March 2024,Traveled with family,"Seoul, South Korea",error,Mostly Disappointing with Very Few Sparks of Excellence.

When inquired, they just told us that there was some kind of a miscommunication. The butler team did give us an extra plate of fruit as a token of apology.

13. Check out process wasn't the smoothest. So we did mention most of our concerns to one of the managers at the hotel. And the butler team gave us some gifts (candle, musical toy, faux leather tray) and the management was gracious enough to promise us a discount of about 16% (which we had in writing via text). However, upon checkout, when we got the bill, the marked discount was 12%. When inquired, we were told this was the first time the staff member had heard about it. The staff member had to go back, check with her team, and came back with the new bill. Although the discount was MUCH appreciated, it was unfortunate that even the check out process wasn't as smooth as it could have been.

And below are not necessarily cons, but just small things the hotel could maybe work on to become a high(er) end hotel:

1. It would be great if the staff all introduced themselves and also remembered our names correctly. I was referred to by the wrong name about 3 to 4 different times by the butler team.

2. While dining at Paiza Sky Residence, which had opened the previous day, one of the servers actually took one of my companion's napkin away in the middle of the meal. I feel like the staff member was trying to freshen up the napkin when we actually put in an additional order, and the staff member walked away to put in the order. But I've actually never seen this happen anywhere else so it was a bit humorous.

3. As mentioned above we were not told of the Paiza Check In counter. Ever. Not only when checking in, but even during our stay. I just feel like this is something that guests need to be at least informed of when any one of the staff at the hotel realizes a guest is staying at one of the Paiza rooms. There were a few other services and details that could have used mentioning/explaining.

All in all, unfortunately, MBS was sorely disappointing...especially for what we paid. Mostly service and communication, and I'd say even the quality of the breakfast spread left quite a lot to be desired. It would be nice to not need a discount or multiple apologies, and rather have had been delivered the expected experience."

Harsh,Apr 2024,"Beautiful hotel with a grand pool, just a couple of things that don't quite hit the mark.","Marina Bay Sands has been one of my dream destinations since 2013, and while our stay was quite luxurious, there were a couple of things which prevent me from rating this place the full 5 stars.

I'll start by listing everything great about the hotel.

I booked a room with a gardens by the bay view. The room itself was a considerable size and the view was incredible as we were on the 27th floor. The bed was large, the room had a charming design (despite us not being in one of the newly renovated ones), the bathroom was well stocked with Roberto Cavalli toiletries, and the minibar was restocked every day with a good selection of soft drinks.

We were also there to celebrate an anniversary and the staff kindly provided us with a small complimentary chocolate cake which tasted incredible. Most of the staff throughout the hotel were also very accommodating and were extremely kind to us.

We opted for the breakfast in our stay and went to the ground floor restaurant every morning. The quality and selection of the food was to a high standard and was some of the best hotel food I've ever eaten.

The rooftop pool was the main reason I booked this hotel and the views were definitely what I had hoped for. They even provide a suncream dispenser free of charge to all guests which was a much needed amenity.

While we were waiting for our room to be ready, and after we checked out, we were provided with a temporary access card which allowed us to use the hotel's facilities such as the pool, which was a nice gesture.

Now onto some minor things which I felt reflected badly on this hotel.

We had just landed in Singapore and wanted to get to our room to rest, however were met with a huge line for check-in, this took away from the luxury feel of a 5 star hotel, but luckily the line moved quickly. The room wasn't ready and the staff told us that they will send us a text when it is, however I advised them that we have new Singaporean SIM cards for our stay, and that they should update the system with it because they had our home numbers saved. They told us that it will be dealt with, however the sms went to our old number, and we had to go to the check in line again a few hours later to see whether our room was ready or not.

We finally got to the room, and one of the staff members entered our room without knocking, this was odd but they did apologise to us and since we had just entered, it wasn't a big deal.

Breakfast queues were also an issue, the staff told us to get there before 8am to ""beat the rush"" which was already a red flag, but we didn't realise how bad it was until we actually went down. The lines in the mornings were extremely long, and did not reflect the amount of money we were paying. Some days we were waiting for up to 30 minutes to be seated. We even tried to go to the top floor restaurant one day as we were told it would be quieter, but the line was even worse than the one downstairs so we avoided it entirely.

Another thing which took away from the opulent feel of the hotel was the pool itself, while the view was amazing, it was incredibly crowded. Some days we had to walk around for a while to even find a seat so that we could sunbathe or put our stuff down. It would only start to quieten down towards the latter part of the evening.

Lastly, we decided one night to go for a drink at the rooftop bar called Ce La Vie. There was a receptionist who'm we asked directions from, but she was too engrossed on her phone to even notice that we were standing in front of her, she finally looked up and asked ""what"" not even realising that we were asking her a question. This isn't the kind of service you'd expect at a hotel like this.

To summarise, it is a good hotel with fancy rooms, nowhere else in the world will you find its picturesque views. Although, I find myself wondering whether I would return due to the aforementioned issues. It seems the hotel justifies its price primarily based on the pool view, however in order to be in line with what they advertise themselves to be, there are some improvements that in my opinion should be made to achieve the reputation that the hotel aims to hold.",4 of 5 bubbles,March 2024,Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",error,"Beautiful hotel with a grand pool, just a couple of things that don't quite hit the mark.",error,"Marina Bay Sands has been one of my dream destinations since 2013, and while our stay was quite luxurious, there were a couple of things which prevent me from rating this place the full 5 stars.

Andrew B,Apr 2024,Cheapest most expensive stay ever,"Well, well, well, where do I start. From the moment you arrive you’re hurdled into a cattle queue that feels like you’re off to be slaughtered. The desks and queuing system resemble that of a primark store, thankfully our front of house was rather kind and actually gave us a newly renovated room hence the 3 stars. You’re not escorted to your room or the lifts which make it difficult because the signage is impossible, the place is built like a maze. Now for the truly exceptional treat to your luxury stay, the rooftop infinity pool! Oh sorry, I meant the butlins water park. The pool is packed full of screaming kids, you might as well be in a water park. Ironically the kids pool didn’t have a single child in. We tried to go for breakfast on the rooftop restaurant, yet again faced with a queue, then upon being shown to our table we were sat on what could only be described as a school lunch table with a backless chair, all for the price of 100 SGD (for 2), we actually left at this point and decided to dine in a local spot nearby for half the price. In the afternoon we sampled the infinity pool and the views are spectacular I have to say but ruined by the flurry of influencers attempting to con their following into thinking they’re living a lavish lifestyle when in actual fact they’re bathing in children’s urine. At this point I decided to order a lemon ice tea which I got the cheque book out for at a whopping 8 dollars. Wow, it came as a punchy lemon juice. I asked the pool side service to replace it and they asked me how I’d like it made, funny enough I actually had an iced lemon tea for 4 dollars in the breakfast place and it was made to perfect without me even asking them! I thought this was supposed to be a 5 star resort?? Lastly, we were advised that upon our checkout after our 2 night stay that we would be allocated a room to have a shower and clean up before our flight as our flight wasn’t until 11pm, and yes you better believe it, there wasn’t any rooms available. There also isn’t any allocated space to change, sit or freshen up. The whole place is actually cleverly designed to feed tourists in, give them a somehow expensive but fictitious experience and huddle you out ready for the next set of unlucky, unaware victims. Stay for 1 night only, enjoy the views and leave to stay at a more customer service central hotel.",3 of 5 bubbles,April 2024,Traveled as a couple,1 contribution,en,Cheapest most expensive stay ever,error,"Well, well, well, where do I start.

BillG,Mar 2024,A unique first class hotel with first class amenities in an amazing location,"MBS is not just a hotel it is a tourist attraction. We stayed there for 5 nights, and the place does not disappoint. Magnificent architecture, GREAT location - you can walk to Gardens by the Bay, a must-see attraction in Singapore - amazing amenities (infinity pool on the 57th floor), first class service and excelente restaurants. You can also ride the escalators down to the basement and find a LARGE number of hawker style food stalls. Relatively expensive but staying there is a unique experience! There was some remodel going on at the time (noise during the day in T3) and as a tourist attraction the lobby is always crowded. One of the breakfast rooms is in 57th floor, right by the roof top pool and breakfast is buffet and/or a la carte. Special mention to Mei Yi that took care of us every single day at breakfast.

brochardy,Mar 2024,Very nice hotel but catering not up to par,"Very nice hotel. Gigantic with its 3 towers and astonishing with its architecture. During our stay in Singapore we spent the first 3 nights there. On our arrival we were very well received in a small lounge for check-in. The Marina Bay garden view room was spacious and comfortable. Very high prices all the same for what is offered. Avoid breakfast in the two restaurants that offer it. We tested on the roof at the Spago restaurant. Very expensive at 75 EUR per person and unremarkable. Are not capable of cooking two fried eggs correctly and the orange juice not even squeezed on site as well as the pastries are unworthy of such an establishment. For breakfast, it's better to go to the ground floor to eat an almond croissant with a coffee at Origin + Bloom at the foot of tower 3. Avoid meals in the hotel's restaurants. Are very expensive. We tried dinner at the Rise restaurant on the ground floor. For more than 100 EUR per person any buffet. Only the champagne was very good at $110, as well as the macaroons from the dessert buffet. At the shellfish buffet everything is cold and the shrimp had no taste. Very pleasant rooftop swimming pool offering a magnificent view of the city and its skyscrapers. Open until midnight. Sipping a cocktail after taking a dip while admiring the magnificent view is an undeniable pleasure. At the foot of the hotel there is a magnificent shopping center but there are only luxury boutiques and local restaurants in the basement at a more affordable end (tower 3 side). Last point if you book a room in this hotel ask for a room in a tower where there is no work!

Subject: EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING EXPERIENCE

Although I know MBS will still fully book no matter how bad their services are, no matter how many complaints they receive, but I still wanna share the bad experiences during my stay on the 8 mar.

1st Booked 7 rooms, sent email to request check in together for all rooms, reservation team replied ok, but during check in, front desk was unfriendly and said cannot check in together because I was not there and my wife checked in for me. My wife requested high floor and only given 7th floor, and she requested to check in together so that my guests will not get low floor, but front desk person said will try their best, so wife requested the lady to prepare all keys and I only need to retrieve when I reached with guests. The front desk lady said ok but when I reached with guests, front desk took 1 HOUR to give me key cards!!! Really really bad!! All the promises were all lies!! My guests are extremely disappointed all due to MBS EMPTY PROMISE AND inflexibility and rigid staff. Despite me paying so much but not getting the right treatment is just basically horrible.

2nd, we got 7th floor room and there was strong sewage smell, wife told the housekeeping but She gave only diffuser and explained cannot do much because smell from drain. The housekeeping lady was nice but she couldn't do much and Wife needed to go off and front desk packed so couldnt request for room change. Ended up we believed the sewage smell or diffuseR cause my son's nose to be sensitive and did not feel well after spending the night there. Really really bad!!! Spent 10k yet stayed in sewage smell room, emailed MBS ask for compensation and yet MBS person said no compensation. Of course la, they wont bother small business from me, they no need do any nice thing hotel also full, so why would they bother about my complaint right! They called me to say sorry but useless la... The sewage smell was obviously full of bacteria.

3rd, the worst part ---we went for breakfast at Spago and my wife almost ingested a part of chipped handglove is really atrocious and disgusting. I seriously thinking of cirluating the photo around but my wife's stopping me from doing so. I was not there with wife, because I was busy, if I were there, should really post the disgusting glove in porridge. They took the glove rather quickly though. So they waived off the breakfast but I think that was only fair because we didnt even eat anything after that disgusting glove! I WANT TO HIGLIGHT THIS, how can a hotel claiming to be a 5 star hotel making such unacceptable nonsense mistake? Totally atrocious. I paid a lot of money for the smelly room with unhygienic retaurant.

Sent few emails but no reply until say will.pst FB, so called to say sorry, which really useless. Compensation should be given but like i said, their business good so they cant be bothered.

I am extremely angry, disappointed and unhappy with my stay at MBS, share with you all la to make this known or I feel sibei imbalance. 10K le!! Yet worth less than 1k for sure!",1 of 5 bubbles,March 2024,Traveled with family,4 contributions,error,Terrible Experience at Hefty Cost,error,"Post on behalf of husband butnI was one of the occupants.

Carry-0ns,Mar 2024,Bucket list hotel,"We splurged to stay here for the final night of our Singapore stopover. We were lucky to get upgraded to a newly renovated room overlooking the park, and it was pure luxury. So this review comes with the caveat that we did not pay full price for the room we got. If we'd stayed in the lower room type we actually booked (which was still incredibly expensive), our review would only be 4 stars because it wouldn't have been as special.

Moving on... The lobby was busy but there were helpful staff to direct us, and check-in was relatively easy. We tried using the app but it wouldn't sync our booking to our room (possibly because of the upgrade?).

The rooftop pool is as amazing as everyone says. Unfortunately we had bad weather and didn't get to fully enjoy it, but can't blame the hotel for that.

If you get a room overlooking the park, you can enjoy the Supertree light show from the comfort of your room! Great for us since it was raining during the show, so we didn't have to risk getting soaked.

They kindly gave us access to a shower room after check-out so we could freshen up before our evening flight home. It was basically a small hotel room (no bed) with the bathroom stocked with amenities, plus water bottles and snacks. Amazing!

It's important to note that all the shops and restaurants in the adjoining mall have significantly inflated prices. Even Starbucks and Din Tai Fung (dumpling restaurant) were way more expensive than at other Singapore locations. On that note, we highly recommend Origin + Bloom cafe in the lobby for a coffee and pastry.

Anna D,Mar 2024,One night only if you must!,"We will certainly never stay here again. First impressions stick and MBS made a lasting impact with our arrival. 5 rows deep of taxi chaos out the front of tower 1 was a prelude. Our luggage was whisked away (more about this later) and we entered without a greeting. Looking up in the lobby is a marvel but at ground level totally inhuman. Packed, nowhere to sit and oddly walled off from the long spectacular space with high wall of a food outlet.

Shockingly our next experience was a three row deep snaking queue to check in. Our wait was 50mins, standing. Trying to download and use their app to check in was fruitless as, on our phones, registration for an account didn’t work. Finally we got to our room (tower 3 a decent walk away) eager to head to the Gardens by the Bay nearby but another wait began for our luggage. We called about its whereabouts twice during our wait of 45mins and no one could tell us where is was or when we could expect it.

Dinner: I mistakenly assumed that staying here we would be able to get a table for a meal. Every table was booked so no such luck. Fortunately as the crowded but incredible rooftop pool was a reason we wanted to stay, we could get a basic meal in our swimmers.
Better communication before arriving could have helped on this point.

Sightseer32705774083,Mar 2024,So bad.... only stay if you deserve punishment,"If I ever have burning desire to:

• Pay for a highfloor harbour-view and receive a lower floor garden-view
• Listen to jackhammers and other refurbishment/construction noises ongoing from 09:00 onwards during my entire stay
• stay in an overrated room which has damages, shoddy completed repairs, and no toilet roll (I have pictures)
• stay in a dirty room with dust everywhere and rust stains on the lamps (I have pictures)
• miss out on Internet, TV and Telephone for more than half a day (unannounced and no updates)
• reregister my keycard again because the elevator no longer accepts my original keycard
• have breakfast at 6:30 because that’s what the advice is and when it is the only time it is not crazy busy
• stand in line for every possible restaurant or feature
• especially just ridiculously overpay for the experience

Only then will I return to the MBS.

I believe that hotel restaurants should cater for guests first and then for 3rd parties. To not be able to reserve a table for the next 2 days as a hotel resident is just absurd.

I was promised unparalleled luxury matched by exceptional service and I got neither – I have travelled extensively in the world including to sunny Nigeria and other parts of Africa and this hotel for me was the biggest disappointment of all - I would rate the premises akin to a single star rating at very best.

Brown_Samantha,Mar 2024,Perfection! Superb service and a million dollar location and view of Singapore,"We started our vacation in Singapore by staying here for 5 nights, and enjoyed every minute of it. Yes, it is a large resort and very busy, but that is part of the glamour and excitement. Our room was in Tower 3 on the 33rd floor overlooking the gardens. We found the room to be very clean, spacious with modern amenities. A ginormous flat screen TV. The resort provided bottled water plus complimentary beverages in the small refrigerator. Nice robes and slippers for our comfort and use during our stay. Also gave us a big platter of fresh fruits upon arrival and mid stay.

The view overlooking the garden was a bonus, as we enjoyed the light shows in the evening right from our room. Facing the gardens also gave us sweeping view to the sea. Part of our reasons for staying here is to use the stunning rooftop infinity pools on the 57th floor. Nothing short of perfection. The pool staff is elite, the food and beverages were superb, and we used the pool during the day as well as at sunset to maximize the amazing views. To see the bright moon light up the sky filled with beautiful city lights was so special.

The location of the resort is also great. Just a walkway to the Gardens By the Bay, as well as to endless restaurants and shops. Even a food court/center, filled with many great eats (in AC!). The MRT is also located nearby. We also used the gym a few times, although with quite a walk from our room. We walked the pedestrian Helix bridge to reach the Singapore Flyer, as well did the short way over to Lau Pa Sat hawker food center. We felt the city is very walkable, even went to the Merilion statue via the route around the waterfront.

As for the resort staff, it is clear that they have extensive service training. Special thanks to the front desk staff for smooth check-in and check-out process. We especially enjoyed talking to Din and Adele at the Concierge desk, they were delightful and so helpful with our questions.

With the highest rating of 5 stars, we really wanted to give the Marina Bay Sands 10! Bravo!",5 of 5 bubbles,February 2024,Traveled as a couple,"Kennewick, Washington",error,Perfection! Superb service and a million dollar location and view of Singapore,error,"We started our vacation in Singapore by staying here for 5 nights, and enjoyed every minute of it. Yes, it is a large resort and very busy, but that is part of the glamour and excitement. Our room was in Tower 3 on the 33rd floor overlooking the gardens. We found the room to be very clean, spacious with modern amenities. A ginormous flat screen TV. The resort provided bottled water plus complimentary beverages in the small refrigerator. Nice robes and slippers for our comfort and use during our stay. Also gave us a big platter of fresh fruits upon arrival and mid stay.

The view overlooking the garden was a bonus, as we enjoyed the light shows in the evening right from our room. Facing the gardens also gave us sweeping view to the sea. Part of our reasons for staying here is to use the stunning rooftop infinity pools on the 57th floor. Nothing short of perfection. The pool staff is elite, the food and beverages were superb, and we used the pool during the day as well as at sunset to maximize the amazing views. To see the bright moon light up the sky filled with beautiful city lights was so special.

The location of the resort is also great. Just a walkway to the Gardens By the Bay, as well as to endless restaurants and shops. Even a food court/center, filled with many great eats (in AC!). The MRT is also located nearby. We also used the gym a few times, although with quite a walk from our room.

michellebrown2000,Mar 2024,I Love This Hotel,"I was in Singapore and knew I had to stay here, I booked a room for us on a Sunday night and was so happy I made the effort to do so, I was in 2 minds whether to book, its an American Vegas style hotel in Asia but it was so worth it you get the fantastic service and hospitality of Singapore but the fun aspect of an American Vegas style hotel. Our check in was seamless Patrick was lovely Peach very helpful and May upgraded us, so we were super happy. Our room was on the 39 floor overlooking the gardens, so nice for the show in the evening (although I would recommend actually being in the gardens for it to get a better experience,if your not there for the show do have a walk around its lovely, the animal sculptures of endangered species is very moving) You walk into your room and the curtains open, a nice touch with a great view. The decor was lovely with some very nice design touches, beds were amazing, bathroom super luxe and toiletries were Jo Malone also being upgraded you get a much nicer robe which becomes obvious when you are at the pool! The pool... so worth it! there is an adults section which is great however being a Sunday there wasn't too many children about, the beds get busy but there is a constant turn around 1 thing we didn't realise there is sun screen provided near the area you do the pool check in. As only hotel guests can use the roof top infinity pool it makes you feel special! the pool is 1 of the reasons to stay at the hotel and it really was a fantastic view and yes I got lots of pictures of me at the edge like in the advert for the hotel! We ate at the pool so food was from Spago a Californian restaurant with a very nice menu, while I was staying elsewhere I came to MBS and ate at CUT by Wolfgang Puck which I highly recommend the chicken is enormous it arrived as a full bird 1.1 kg they took it away and carved it for me. While staying at MBS we ate at the new French restaurant DB Bistro which we didn't enjoy so much maybe it was not to our taste? We visited the casino, free to tourists but $150 for locals! you must have your passport and Singapore landing card to enter. No quite as much fun as a Vegas casino the games are a little different and the gambling seemed more intense, but we had to give it a go and it was a nice finish to our evening. I read a lot about this hotel and on my visit to eat there before my stay there I was a little shocked how busy it was and felt it was almost a little too touristy, but that aside the architecture is totally amazing, the staff superb, if you love to shop the mall is great every shop you could possible wish for if you like high end, the evening light and water shows are a nice touch and I must say my whole experience was 10/10 we loved it, would I return now that I have done the pool and casino YES I would.",5 of 5 bubbles,February 2024,Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",error,I Love This Hotel,error,"I was in Singapore and knew I had to stay here, I booked a room for us on a Sunday night and was so happy I made the effort to do so, I was in 2 minds whether to book, its an American Vegas style hotel in Asia but it was so worth it you get the fantastic service and hospitality of Singapore but the fun aspect of an American Vegas style hotel.

Breakfast can get a bit busy, so to avoid queueing up I would suggest arriving for breakfast at around 8:0am. There is plenty of selection at breakfast and the staf are efficient.
The hotel is connected to the MRT, Shopping mall and casino so its very easy to get around. The super tree grove, Floral fantasy, Cloud forest and flower dome are all within walking diatance.
The infinity pool at the rooftop is great for one of those photo opportunities, as is the observation deck. Both are free for guests. The pool is for guests only, whilst the observation deck is chargeable for non guests.

Tisha A,Mar 2024,The best hotel in Singapore,"Marina Bay Sands is hands down my favorite hotel in all of Singapore. I stayed in the newly renovated rooms in tower 2 and had a beautiful view of the Gardens by the Bay. The mall attached is breathtaking and the hotel offers so many restaurants you can’t go wrong with any of them. Lavo was amazing for a rooftop experience (highly recommend the meatball!) , Wakudu had the freshest fish if you’re looking for high end Japanese cuisine, and you can’t go wrong with room service.

Every part of the hotel is a work of art. Almost every part is a picturesque moment! The rooftop pool is breathtaking and is the best view in Singapore. Also, Marquee is the coolest club you’ll ever go to. A Ferris wheel and slide attached that you can’t miss.

Most of all, the employees and premium services were extremely catering, helpful and fast. Shoutout to Eunice from Premium Guest Services for going above and beyond each day of my stay. She gave me all the best recommendations and she was swift with all my responses. She also assisted me with all my rides to and from the hotel with ease.

This hotel has it all! If you’re just visiting, I highly recommend staying for at least 2 nights to explore all MBS has to offer!

We booked one of the newly renovated Family suites, and I must say that we have never experienced such luxury. Not only the facilities was extraordinary but the hospitality and service from the MBSPremium Services was next level and beyond our expectations.
Starting from pre arriving until checking out and after they just took care of us and helped if we needed anything. House keeping was nursing the room every time we left and freshened up everything.

Iain P,Feb 2024,Fantastic experience!!,"We booked two nights at the Marina Sands to end our trip to Singapore.
What can possibly be said about staying at such an iconic hotel.
The experience alone is amazing and with so much to take in can be a bit overwhelming.
( Definitely in a good way ).
The roof terrace and pool are just amazing and the views are incredible.
We had a fabulous room overlooking the gardens and watched the light show from our balcony.
I was taken aback by the structure of this hotel but what impressed me more was the way the staff seemed to run everything so efficiently,from the breakfast on the ground floor which was fine with plenty of choice available,to the bar service by the pool.
The check in was straightforward and when we checked out,we were given our pool access cards back which enabled us to enjoy the rest of the day relaxing before our 12:30 am flight home.
I must mention the lovely Ivy and Sara whose patience with me at the check in and checkout desks was impeccable.
Also Shasi who brought our
luggage and told me all about the hotel.
A real nice guy.
All in all an experience that will be impossible to forget.

Hugo Mettler,Feb 2024,Not worth the high price.,"The hotel is getting old. The elevator stopped where it wanted to, but not where you wanted to go. There was construction on our floor. 44th floor, Tower 3. Jackhammers all day. Unbearable. We weren't told about it. Discount? Nonsense. They just smiled and ignored it. Resting during the day was impossible. The room was stylish, but totally impractical. Only a fixed shower head. You can't clean your bottom or the soles of your feet. Taps with separate hot and cold water. You never find the right mix. The tap is much too close to the sink. Washing your hands is impossible. The toilet is nice and open. You can see in from every side (who likes that?) and it stinks so much in the whole room. There is just one chair in the room that you can sit on. The seating area is also stylish, but just as impractical to sit on. And you can't reach the ""salon table"" unless you're over 2 meters tall. I'm ""only"" 167 cm tall. So no chance.
The only thing that's great is the view from the 44th floor. Everything else didn't convince me. It's all very overpriced and not worth the price.
The breakfast buffet is huge but mostly designed for Asians. For Europeans, it's not worth the exorbitant price. Here you get a 3-course meal.
There is no hotel lobby for guests. As a hotel guest, you can't charge your electronic device anywhere (except in your own room). It happened to me when I had to leave the room but had paid until the end of the day. Very bad service for the year 2024, when you can only do everything electronically.
Conclusion: Once and never again.
By the way: You can access the top floor (57th floor) where the swimming pool is if you rent such an expensive room, but I personally never found a place by the swimming pool, let alone at the bar, because everything was occupied all day.

Kathryn A,Feb 2024,What an experience,"Wow. Firstly, as a quick “down side”, be warned that there are a lot of people in the foyer. But even though there are lots of people, the customer service team have a knack for seeking you out amongst the crowd to see if you need anything. How they manage to know who is who is beyond me. Room is impressive. But the real highlight is of course the infinity pool and deck. It’s magnificent and the service that comes with it is what makes it so iconic. Thank you to Christy who treated my 5 year old son like he was royalty. Despite the price, the deck is considerably child friendly (I thought it wouldn’t be). There is a separate adults only section to prevent annoying relaxed adults. Food and beverage was fantastic but be prepared, it’s pricey I found the cafe downstairs (Bloom) decently priced for a coffee and croissant.

Plenty of chairs, lots of room in the pool and really prompt service for food and drink. A special mention for Mark who looked after us each day. The views of Singapore from the pool deck are breathtaking. One side is the City and the other side is the Harbor which resembles a full car park of ships waiting to load or unload. Received a phone call to advise our room was ready. Rooms are very well appointed as you would expect for the price. Only issue was the provided pillows were like bricks.

bengch,Feb 2024,Excellent Stay at MBS,"I am with my elderly parents and my older brother who flew all the way from Canada to celebrate the 87th and 81st birthday of our Dad and Mom.
I booked the 2 Sands Premier Suite since December 2023 as I wanted to make our parents’ birthday memorable.
I emailed the MBS to avail the Merlion Suite originally as we stayed there in July 2022 but unfortunately its apparently under renovation.
So I settled for the 2 Sands Premier Suite instead.
I roped in the help of MBS n Januat 2024 to have my parents’ room decorated with flowers, balloons, birthday greetings, champagne and fruits and MBS threw in complimentary cakes as well.
I also requested 2 wheelchairs and possible early check-in and late check out too.
3 days before our visit to MBS , they send a reminder for out check-ins and I confirmed with then all the pre-arranged surprises for my parents.
The room reservation, room-in dining , Bayfloral all have confirmed that all the arrangement are smoothly on the way, although some miscommunications happened when I was confirming the arrangements but…
What impressed me the most was the MBS premium services that oversee that all the arrangement will happen and more… Ms. Precious, Ms Lucy of MBS premium service and in-room dining addressed all my concerns and Ms. Maria of Bayfloral as well thru our communications via email. MBS premium services sent a message to give them a heads up once we ate on our way, as the 2 wheel chairs will be waiting for us.
On the day of our arrival Ms. Eunice Marasigan was waiting for us at the lobby, though I missed the message who are we supposed to meet thus, we alighted from our transportation and proceeded to request for wheelchairs. When Ms. Eunice spotted us that’s where the magic started… from the very start she assisted us with genuine warmth and sincerity, she was honest that the 2 rooms are being prepared as well as the surprises, so she lead us to RENKU for complimentary breakfast where Sheila assisted us while waiting as Eunice checked in for all of us,and provided us temporary keys for the gym and infinity pool. Since we anticipated that rooms might not be ready yet, we had a lunch reservation at RISE so Sheila of RENKU helped us move to RISE restaurant with all our complimentary drinks in tow.
While having our lunch buffet at RISE, Eunice keeps us updated with our rooms( we requested if PAIZAPremier Suite is available instead but unfortunately not), she surprised my parents with cakes and birthday song compliments of RISE staffs( separate review on this).
Once our rooms are ready, we were led to it and MBS wowed us with the floral arrangements, balloons and birthday greetings( c/o Bayfloral) adorned the room of my parents and the fruits and Piper-Heidsieck Champagne (c/o MBS in-room dining) with complimentary MBS cakes and fruits as well. My parents were so surprised and overwhelmed!! Goal achieved!
Ms.Eunice also helped us how to go to KOMA for our dinner resevation ( separate review) and she also readied our transportation for the next day to our lunch reservation to ATLAS( another review) a complimentary limousine ride. She always updated and assured us during our stay.
She come across as a very genuine, sincere staffs who is going above and beyond, MBS is fortunate to have her as she will definitely brought her A game and made the guests feels very special. Kudos as well to Jeff and Jonald who assisted us on our check-out and the kind gentleman whom I forgot to get his name who drove is to ATLAS.
We woke up late the next day and still tired so we decided to order a in-room dining for breakfast instead of availing our complimentary brekkie to RISE and Spago. It’s very convenient to oraer thru TV and very promptly delivered. Variety of choices too. After that we went to infinity pool but to do photo shoots only as we are rushed for our next appointment.

The hotel is stunning, seriously high end, and there isn’t anything the MBS team won’t do for you to make your stay as comfortable as possible.

Our family suite was phenomenal and our girls loved the play room/bedroom (Nintendo Switch).

The food here is exceptional. We had breakfast at Rise each morning and had a special anniversary meal at Spago on the rooftop, which was outstanding!

I think for what you get at this hotel, its truly value for money, the hotel staff truly care about your comfort throughout your stay and let’s be frank, there are no better views in Singapore than here.

Chicagojr29,Feb 2024,Avoid Marina Bay Sands During Construction!,"Just checked out of Marina Bay Sands. I have stayed at the hotel 15 times before. Just a word of warning:

1. Construction is incredibly noisy from 9 am to 6 pm and on weekends. It is Loud. The bed is hard as a rock and I hope they change it out.

2. They were working on the room above us and knocked out the air conditioning and the electric.
3. I never complain and mentioned it a checkout saying paying $1,000 for a room with no AC and packing my bags in the dark is ridiculous.
4 There response was we are sorry, no credit to your $1,000 room and have a nice day.

The only reason you should go to Marina Bay now is if you are dead set on the pool. The pool is great, but the construction is over the top loud and the hotel really doesn't have to care as there is always another unsuspecting guest.

Raggidolli,Feb 2024,"Great pool, big rooms, but lots of people","During our three-day stay at the Marina Bay Sands in Singapore, in a Deluxe Room Sky View, at a price of around 690 euros per night, we experienced both outstanding and in need of improvement. The room impressed with its spaciousness, floor-to-ceiling windows and a separate bathroom and toilet area, which could also be accessed independently. Although the water pressure in the shower was satisfactory, it could have been stronger for an optimal shower experience. The acoustic insulation of the bathroom, which made it possible to shower without disturbing people in the sleeping area, deserves special mention.

The breathtaking view of the city from our room, which was cleaned several times a day and provided with fresh towels, as well as the exceptionally comfortable bed, significantly enhanced our stay. A key reason for our choice of hotel was the famous rooftop pool, whose phenomenal view and nightly opening times until 11 p.m. offered an unforgettable experience. The water temperature of the pool was okay and it was not particularly crowded during the week.

However, some experiences clouded our overall picture. The check-in process proved to be lengthy and comparable to that of an economy check-in line at the airport, with a waiting time of around 20 minutes and an additional time of around 15 minutes for the processing itself due to room issues. In addition, the digital check-in via app, which was advertised in advance, resulted in repeated error messages due to system overloads. The breakfast, although acceptable overall, did not meet the expectations of variety and quality that we are used to from comparable hotels in Bangkok. The crowded and noisy conditions in the breakfast room, as well as the cramped seating arrangement, especially indoors, diminished the dining experience. Only the outdoor area was not as tightly packed, but was affected by some traffic noise.

The location of the hotel was consistently convincing with excellent connections to the public transport network thanks to a subway station in the basement and the possibility of exploring the surrounding area easily on foot.

We booked 1 night stay as a treat to be able to use the infinity pool. What an experience. Wished we had booked 2 nights.

Arrived and as we opened the door all the automatic lights came on , curtains opened with a view across the harbour and down onto the Supertree Grove. We were celebrating a birthday which I had noted on reservation and we had a birthday cake delivered to the room by the butler. Did not even know we had one !!. Room was not ideal for 3 people but we made the best of it abd used the facilites that were on offer. They even had a karoke set up in the living room so we had a great time using that.

PJ C,Feb 2024,"Not family friendly, treats teens as adults for pool access","MBS is well known but in my opinion overrated. The rooms are overpriced for the type of room you get. I work remotely and take my work with me when I travel. Most 5* hotels have a business center. When I asked the front desk one of the staff was confused as to what a business center was. Another staff then said their business center is in the convention center but it’s all booked. I have a feeling they don’t really know what a business center is and that they don’t have one. I don’t mind working from the room, but I prefer working from a business center or a lounge area. There is no convenient lounge area. This hotel doesn’t even have a real lobby to rest your legs.

We were only here for a few days. We also tried their dinner buffet which was very good. Service was a bit slow though it is CNY and a busy time. When we were seated we were informed our champagne would be served right away. It was about after our second round of getting food that our champagne was actually served. Then when we paid the bill our server asked for us to stay at our dining table so they can double check our room number is correct. After waiting for 5-10 minutes the server never came back to let us know we can leave. We had to hunt down help to confirm it was okay to leave the dining area.

The other area we accessed was the pool. The worker “Vicky” was checking in guests. I understand the pool is for guests only and you need to swipe a card per adult guest. I have three kids and they claimed my two teenagers ages 15 and 16 are adults. And they would “let me in this time” but next time to register them so they have their own hotel room card to access the pool. I’ve never heard of such a ridiculous requirement and shouldn’t this be something when we were checking in that the front desk advise us of?

To not have any rooms available until 3 pm is understandable, albeit inconvenient - but to not have a single seating area available for guests to wait in is absolutely unconscionable. There are ZERO chairs / couches anywhere on the first floor, they've decided to monetize by giving every last inch to the buffet.

My elderly parents are traveling with us, and we had to walk around for 30 minutes looking for a place to sit. We finally squeezed in a beach in the food court area in the mall to wait an hour for our rooms.

I was then called, and specifically told ALL three rooms we booked were available (I made sure to ask). We all walked back (again - a long distance) to be told, just kidding, only one of the three was currently available. What should my elderly parents do in that case?

Finally, even after we made it to the rooms - it was literally a 45 minute wait for our luggage to arrive.

I have traveled extensively around the globe, and Marina Bay Sands ranks amongst the very bottom.

Matthias Sempels,Feb 2024,"Humongous, unique hotel, magnificent pool (but photos taken by photographer are too expensive!)","The main reason I chose this hotel for the second time, is the marvellous infinity pool. Be sure to spend at least a few hours in the pool and jacuzzi. This location is unique for great pictures and videos. Before sunrise and sunset are not to be missed.

The hotel itself is enormous, but most (like the delicious restaurants, the Shoppes and the shows) is also accessible to non-hotel guests. So, make sure to explore this hotel, even if you’re not a guest, it’s an experience in itself.

The staff is very friendly, giving tips and helping out when necessary. One time I got out of the pool at 23:51, and my belongings (luckily only my room card inside my hotel bathjacket) were taken away prematurely. So be aware of this if you intend to stay in the pool until midnight to not lose your valuables! I thus had to go to the first floor with a new jacket and towel I had received by the staff at the pool to obtain a new room card.

Breakfast was very expensive, so if you consider having breakfast, try allocating more time and making a brunch out of it at the Rise restaurant. This way, you kinda get 2 meals for the same price, which makes it more affordable.

The room was good, with a nice view on Gardens By The Bay for us. I would have liked a movable spray head in the shower though, as a fixed one is not handy.

The fitness is good enough with various machines, and helps you keep in shape for the duration of your stay.

The hotel is expensive though, which is normal for the luxury you obtain in return. The reason which refrains me from giving this hotel 5 stars, is the absurd price of purchasing the photos a photographer has taken of you at the pool itself. The cheapest option was 120 SGD and to get all your photos digitally too, the price becomes 145 SGD, if I am not mistaken. I get that they know their audience is whealthy (otherwise they wouldn’t be able to afford such an expensive hotel), but to me it really feels like a tourist trap. It’s not like the photographer stayed 15 minutes with you to capture you from all the best angles. It was just a minute, some poses at the same spot, and that’s it. Feels like bandwork and not worth more than 20 SGD. Even though, I purchased the photos because I am fascinated by your infinity pool, but it gave a bitter aftertaste which damped my experience a bit.

Shout-out to Fir (@firtography1985 on Instagram) though, who volunteered to make great photos of us at the pool at sunrise with our phone!

Conclusion: I will certainly come back in the future because I love Singapore, Marina Bay, the restaurants and the Infinity Pool, but reviewing your paid photograph service at the pool would be a good thing.",4 of 5 bubbles,February 2024,Traveled as a couple,"Landen, Belgium",error,"Humongous, unique hotel, magnificent pool (but photos taken by photographer are too expensive!)",error,"The main reason I chose this hotel for the second time, is the marvellous infinity pool.

dfang19,Feb 2024,"Appalling stay at MBS, still waiting for recovery from their team days after check out!","I am a local who has been to Marina Bay Sands multiple times. Just to contextualise my stay, I was only at MBS to take some important work calls and to relax while my house was under renovation, but I ended up having to experience so much stress from:
1. A security breach issue that I encountered with someone else (not my guest or I) who definitely came into our room to eat one of our snacks in the mini-bar area and subsequently left the empty package beside the room refrigerator (see photo attached);
2. Equipment in my room not working (Netflix not syncing to the TV screen in the room);
3. Billing issues throughout my stay (where I had to spend more than half my stay calling or emailing their reservations team and also going down to the check-in counter at least 3 times in-person to get my billing issue resolved)
4. Not having the room service staff provide me with my birthday amenity first thing upon check-in (the friend who booked my room at MBS kept asking if the hotel did anything for me and I had to wait for hours and ask twice before anything came to my room, and my friend who did my room booking was severely disappointed that I didn’t receive anything for a long while although he put a note in for this upon booking my room);
5. Not having my Sands Lifestyle rewards membership card credited with the rewards dollars within 48 hours of my check-out (I am still following up on this issue…)

A Nicole Yu from the hotel’s recovery team has done an investigation into the security breach issue where someone in their staff team entered my room to eat from my snack bar (but not to make up my room) while I was away from my room for lunch on the second day of my stay, but they claimed none of the staff who entered my room ate the snack (then who did, a ghost?) and informed me that they couldn’t do anything else for me as I had checked out of the hotel (the issue wasn’t resolved before I checked out anyway…so whose fault is that)? She said I could come back again to experience the hotel but why would I pay to return when I had such a stressful stay at a hotel that a) Isn’t cheap and b) is supposedly iconic to Singapore?

I have photos to share of the empty nut package by my fridge which I discovered in my room, and would like to escalate this matter to someone more senior within the hotel, but Nicole has ghosted me for the past 24 hours. I am only posting here because I haven’t had my issues resolved and am still waiting for someone from their team to get back to me.

If you’re thinking of staying at the hotel, be warned…the service is appalling and you’re paying top dollar for this.

Gazman64,Feb 2024,Great staff who gave us a once in a lifetime experience with exceptional service,"We had the most outstanding experience at Marina Bay Sands. From the moment we checked in, the hospitality, friendliness and service was exceptional.

Yve who checked us in was knowledgeable, attentive and her customer service skills were excellent. Once checked into our suite, Marvin our Butler greeted us at the lifts and escorted us to our room. We're very grateful for Marvin's enthusiasm for his role, his friendliness and excellent service. Nothing was too much trouble as he helped organise our stay from booking a poolside cabana, afternoon drinks & canapes and a sunrise breakfast to name a few of the experiences. He even hand made a beautiful birthday card and brought us a delicious cake to acknowledge and celebrate the birthday event which was the reason for our trip.

Every aspect of our suite was superbly luxurious and included amazing city and sea views. Relaxing by the Infinity Pool overlooking the beautiful city views of Singapore was also a highlight.

Wherever we went, the staff were friendly, engaging and nothing was too much trouble. Club @ Renku, Spago, Ce La Vie, Concierge & Luggage services, Poolside Bar, Limousine service, Yve, Marvin and Christelle at the airport...across all these areas, it is true to say customer service at Marina Bay Sands is outstanding.

Thank you again to everyone at Marina Bay Sands. This was an experience we will never forget.

From the moment we checked in, the hospitality, friendliness and service was exceptional.

Yve who checked us in was knowledgeable, attentive and her customer service skills were excellent. Once checked into our suite, Marvin our Butler greeted us at the lifts and escorted us to our room. We're very grateful for Marvin's enthusiasm for his role, his friendliness and excellent service. Nothing was too much trouble as he helped organise our stay from booking a poolside cabana, afternoon drinks & canapes and a sunrise breakfast to name a few of the experiences. He even hand made a beautiful birthday card and brought us a delicious cake to acknowledge and celebrate the birthday event which was the reason for our trip.

Irina Vatras,Feb 2024,Hotel icon of Singapore.,"Great hotel, probably the best location in Singapore if you want to visit the main attractions in a short period of time. And the view of the city from the room is worth every penny spent on this hotel. We read bad reviews and were afraid to go, but absolutely in vain. The room has everything you need, a free minibar with water, juices and chips, a coffee machine.
Well, you don’t even have to comment about the pool. Perfect white soft towels, good service. Probably the only negative is the lack of umbrellas for the sun loungers. Probably on purpose so that they don’t lie there for a long time 😁.
As for breakfasts. Breakfast in two locations: on the ground floor and on 57. Never go to 57 😁, on the ground floor there are excellent breakfasts with a huge selection, on 57 there is nothing to eat 😁, very little choice.",5 of 5 bubbles,February 2024,Traveled with family,121 contributions,error,Hotel icon of Singapore.,error,"Great hotel, probably the best location in Singapore if you want to visit the main attractions in a short period of time.

Colin H,Feb 2024,Very poor,"Arrived on the Wednesday after a long flight from Paris. After getting something to eat we thought it would be nice to get a drink back at the hotel. The first bar we tried at the top of tower 1 was closed for a private function. We were advised to try the bar at the top of tower 3. Went there only to be advised that if we wanted to sit at one of the reserved tables, and they were all reserved, there was a minimum spend of $1000. Being just my wife and I we were not going to get anywhere near this. Absolutely ridiculous for a hotel that claims to care about the customer experience! We had booked in for 4 nights and thought it might be nice to move to a hotel that actually cares about their guests only to be told that we could get a refund for the unused nights it would take 4 weeks to process. Ended up having a drink in a restaurant on the ground floor, not the 57th floor with all the views.

Although we gave the hotel a 4 stars, there were still negatives. The 4 stars were mostly due to the hotel architecture itself.

Now for the negatives. The hotel was extremely busy so check-in process took a very long time. In fact we had two rooms and one of the rooms was not ready for hours. The rooftop pool on the top of the hotel was crazy busy. We could not find a place to sit. Looks like there are a lot of one night stay guest who just want to experience the hotel for a night.

MBS became their standard for a stay cation which we haven't found any match yet.
During our stay, I would like to commend the services of the staffs, especially those assigned in the infinity pool and concierge. Mr Cornelius was very kind and polite when we checked-in.
When we are in the infinity pool, Mr Dennis, Mr Ramon and Ms Vicky were very friendly and courteous, especially Mr. Dennis.
Mr. Dennis has showed the hospitality trait of being a Filipino. He always checks on us and other guests if we are okay and enjoying the infinity pool. Especially those with kids like me.

This is my family's first choice for stay cation. Even though it is not our first time in MBS, the excitement were still there, especially for my kids. MBS became their standard for a stay cation which we haven't found any match yet.
During our stay, I would like to commend the services of the staffs, especially those assigned in the infinity pool and concierge. Mr Cornelius was very kind and polite when we checked-in.
When we are in the infinity pool, Mr Dennis, Mr Ramon and Ms Vicky were very friendly and courteous, especially Mr. Dennis.
Mr. Dennis has showed the hospitality trait of being a Filipino. He always checks on us and other guests if we are okay and enjoying the infinity pool. Especially those with kids like me.
Over all it was exciting, fun and always memorable.
Definitely, we will come back again! Thank you MBS!"

There was a long line and for some reason she was struggling to get our room arranged. I had some trouble pre-registering with the APP and she was able to overcome all of that and not only solved the problem, but some how, and for some reason, was able to upgrade us to a VIP room.

Lillo Pistacchio,Jan 2024,One of the icons of Singapore,"When you book at the Marina you don't book a room, but you book an experience....our experience begins by arriving by taxi in the hall which has six taxi lanes. Once you have stopped, the hotel attendants open the door for you and unload your bags.
They accompany you to the hall where they issue a coupon to identify your suitcase which you will find in the room. At the check inn you are offered water and chupa chups, and while they enter your passport details, they ask you how your trip went and tell you about your room. Our room was a Deluxe city view on the 25th floor, approximately halfway up the skyscraper, in fact it has 57 floors where the iconic swimming pool stands majestically on the top. Upon entering you have a long corridor where the bathroom is located on the right with 3 separate areas, for toilet, shower and king sink. Continuing we arrive at the large and comfortable bed where we have a nice 75 TV at the front, which I didn't watch since the view of the skyline was much better. Desk and minibar included complete the room.
To give you an idea, the whole complex is taller than the Eiffel Tower.
The swimming pool, exclusive only for hotel guests, rests on 3 towers, our room was in tower 3. Below the hotel is the shopping center with restaurants and all branded shops, casino and theatre. In the evening you can see the show with the fountains dancing in the water or the lights of the trees in the garden bay. The next morning breakfast is at the ""Lo Spago"" restaurant next to the swimming pool on the 57th floor, by presenting your room card you are accompanied to the table, it could be the low Japanese one, or the normal one. You order drinks from the waiter and go independently to the large buffet area. Breakfast is mostly savory, but there are croissants, chocolate croissants, bread and the inevitable Nutella. I also tasted some excellent pancakes with maple juice, cream and jam. Juices, coffee and cappuccino are a must.
Check out is at 12, the bags are collected in the room and the magnetic keys are delivered quickly, just insert them into the totem.

signed_steph,Jan 2024,Disappointed;bad room assignment,"Everything was amazing on check in. Great staff, great service and amazing spacious room in Tower 3 - spot on what we expected when booking. What was NOT expected was the horrendous construction that was going on upstairs flooding our entire room.

I was so angry. On booking, I paid a small additional sum for my 6month old baby as a ‘guest’. I notified them that we have a baby, and they even put a cot and a baby bath in the room EXCEPT they also put us downstairs from 9-6 construction. My little baby, who is meant to do 3-4naps a day would not stop crying and both my husband and I had to escalate escalate escalate over a 3hr period, where I ended up sitting in the hallway in tears too, before we were given an adequate replacement room by one of the Guest Service Managers, Xavier. Terrible experience; having stayed at MBS many times in the past - I was shocked at their oversight and the time it took to rectify.

Other reasons for my rating include a very mediocre breakfast. The chef we had on both mornings couldn’t get our omelettes right (we wanted fresh eggs, instead of the pre-made egg mix and egg whites); we end up just eating croissants and mini muffins that were pretty dry.

Michael V,Jan 2024,Terrible experience,"We normally stay at the Four Seasons when in Singapore and it was a big mistake staying here on our visit this time. Outdated rooms no where near a five star standard. The beds were so hard and felt like sleeping on wood. Bath towels were small and felt like sandpaper.

Our 3 nights stay was beyond our expectations. We booked one of the newly renovated rooms and the online photos really didn't do justice. The room was large, more like a suite than a room. It is beautifully designed with all the modern fittings and fixtures, and well catered to feel like a luxury home away from home. We have stayed in many luxury hotels around the world, but never had a room with 75inch TV, a tea bar and cocktail bar. I could write forever about how much we loved the room and all the fantastic amenities.

The hotel itself also ticked all the boxes. With shopping, restaurants, train and tourist attractions at its doorsteps, there's a lot to do without travelling very far.

The swim in the infinity pool certainly did not disappoint. The views from the pool are simply breathtaking and impossible to stop taking photos from all angles at different times of the day and night.
