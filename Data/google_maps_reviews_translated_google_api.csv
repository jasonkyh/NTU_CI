Katrina Anna D. Chua,5/5,"It was one of the best 5-star experience for me. I enjoyed every bit of the room - all clean down to the last detail. Kudos to the staff of the hotel - cannot thank them enough for the wonderful service. The hotel might have cost a lot but every dollar is worth the price. You get your money's worth when you decide to try and stay at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. The room is spacious and spotless. The furniture and necessities are modern. I can even praise the shower for having soft water bubbles. The breakfast buffet at the Rise was also enjoyable with lots of options that satisfy. The check in and check out process were seamless and pleasant. Thank you, Marina Bay Sands. My husband and I had the most amazing time.","a month ago on

Joanne Bodanio,5/5,"Me and my partner visited Marina Bay Sands during our trip to Singapore. Even though we were not checked in at the hotel, the outside view was already so amazing and beautiful. The architecture is iconic, and the atmosphere around the area is vibrant, especially at night when the lights and the skyline come alive. It’s truly one of the must-see landmarks in Singapore, and we really enjoyed just walking around and taking photos.","3 weeks ago on

Mayi Barov,5/5,"Marina Bay Sands is in a fantastic location, right in the heart of Singapore with easy access to shopping, restaurants, and attractions. The views from the hotel are incredible, especially from the famous infinity pool, which we enjoyed so much and also the friendly service for drinks and food!
The property offers a variety of dining options, high-end shops, a casino, and a connected mall that has everything you need.

Breakfast was excellent with a huge variety of choices, and I really enjoyed the afternoon tea as well. Our room was very spacious, very comfortable, and had everything we needed. The toiletries were high quality, and the room was kept very clean throughout our stay. The staff were very attentive at all times, concierge was so helpful. We felt welcome from start to finish.

It’s the kind of hotel where you can easily spend the whole day without leaving, but it’s also perfectly located for exploring the city. Overall, it was a wonderful stay!","a month ago on

Rio Clio,5/5,"The hotel was perfect for our one-night stay before our return flight to Europe. The service was excellent, from the luggage service to check-in and further assistance. The room was well-appointed with a great view over the bay. The infinity pool was a particular highlight, but unfortunately it was almost overcrowded in the evening. We would have liked to stay longer – maybe we'll come back again!","3 weeks ago on

F W,5/5,"This was an absolutely amazing hotel to stay at. We only stayed for one night - the last night of our trip but I wish we could have stayed longer. The staff were so friendly and kind from the moment we entered the hotel until we left.
A special mention to Hui Fei who checked us in and was very welcoming and kind.
The food was amazing as was the pool and all facilities. Nothing was too much trouble and I’m going to save to stay here for longer next time we visit Singapore.","2 weeks ago on

Sujay Sreekumar,5/5,"Amazing building and architecture. Looks really impressive from the outside as well as inside. The hotel is great, we went up for the rooftop view, below there is a huge mall, convention centre and lot of activities inside. It is surrounded by multiple tourist spots, cultural museum, promenade and what not! If you come to Singapore, this is a must visit place. Can spend 5-6 hours nearby easily. Recommended!","a month ago on

Waldemar KLIMCZAK,5/5,"The most important place in Singapore, a must-see for everyone. I especially enjoyed the nighttime experience. Everyone comes here to watch the light show.

Salva Mirza,5/5,"Our Marina Bay Sands stay has been nothing less than the extraordinary! I had chosen their hotel to celebrate my husband’s birthday and they have truly made it an unforgettable experience! We stayed at their Sands Premier Suite facing the city and it was breathtaking! Major credit to Vivian at the front desk who was extremely amicable, warm and welcoming! She has made sure our celebration was x10 times better! Thanks a ton, Vivian! 😊

Also would like to mention, Ms. Joan at the Express Service Team, was very meticulously paying attention to our requisites! Thank you! 😊

M CH,5/5,"We first stayed at Marina Bay Sands 13 years ago, and this time we returned for just one night. Check-in was smooth and efficient — we received a temporary room card that already gave us access to the pool, which was very convenient. We decided to do some shopping first, and when we returned to collect our official room cards, we were pleasantly surprised to learn that we had been given an upgrade. This gesture was truly appreciated.

As always, the pool and the food were excellent. You have the option to enjoy breakfast either by the pool or downstairs. If you're looking for a large buffet and don’t mind a lively atmosphere, the downstairs option is ideal. However, if you prefer a quieter, more refined experience with a set menu, the poolside breakfast is the better choice.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would be happy to return again in the future.","a month ago on

Ceniya J,5/5,"While Marina Bay Sands dazzles visitors with its luxury shopping, world-class restaurants, and breathtaking architecture, my lasting memory comes from a group often overlooked: the housekeeping team.

During what was otherwise a very difficult trip, these professionals became the highlight of my stay. The scale of their work is extraordinary—cleaning massive, high-tech rooms with meticulous precision, restocking coolers and amenities, and ensuring no detail is overlooked, all within tight time frames. As someone with severe OCD, I notice everything, and I was genuinely in awe.

One housekeeper, in particular, came to refill my ice bucket—something I didn’t even need—yet she bowed repeatedly and apologized as though she were inconveniencing me. Her humility and dedication were deeply touching. Later, another staff member surprised me with a vegan birthday cake, complete with a candle. I had forgotten it was even my birthday, but that thoughtful gesture nearly brought me to tears. It wasn’t just a dessert; it was a reminder that I was seen and valued.

In a hotel renowned for grandeur, it’s the quiet diligence of the housekeeping team that, in my view, forms the true backbone of Marina Bay Sands. They made me feel special, cared for, and genuinely welcome. I would return not just for the stunning rooms, but to personally thank and see these remarkable individuals again.

Thank you so much for this experience, it made my birthday trip.","a month ago on

ChuLuxe Explorer,5/5,"Marina Bay Sands is one of the most stunning places I’ve visited in Singapore. That day I spent time walking around, enjoying the view, and taking photos. The architecture is so iconic and the whole place feels elegant and beautifully designed. Even just strolling along the promenade was relaxing and memorable.

What made the day truly unforgettable was having dinner at the rooftop bar, right at the highest point of the building. The view was absolutely breathtaking. I watched the sunset paint the sky in warm colors, followed by a full moon rising above the city skyline. It was one of those moments that just takes your breath away. Everything felt magical. The atmosphere, the view, the food, the soft breeze,  it all came together perfectly.

Whether you’re staying at the hotel or just visiting, this is a place you should not miss. It’s a must-see in Singapore and a memory I’ll always keep with me.","2 months ago on

leotrails,5/5,"This is one of the iconic spots I always visit when I’m in Singapore, and it totally lives up to the hype. From the moment I walk in, it feels like I’m stepping into something grand, boujee, and massive. The Shoppes here offer luxury shopping at its finest: sleek, shiny, and filled with high-end brands like Chanel, Gucci, and Louis Vuitton. Basically, it’s window-shopping heaven if you’re not there to splurge.

But it’s not all about designer labels. There are great dining options too, from fancy restaurants to casual cafés with beautiful views of the waterfront. And yes, the indoor canal with gondola rides adds a fun, over-the-top touch. There’s also the casino: sleek, expansive, and brimming with indulgences for those who want a premium gaming experience.

Even if you’re not buying anything, it’s a cool spot to stroll, people-watch, and soak in all the glam.","Edited a month ago on

Ngọc Báu,5/5,"1. The Landscape – Clean, Refined, and Aesthetically Pleasing

What struck me most upon arriving in Singapore was how neatly orchestrated everything felt — as if every corner had been thoughtfully composed. The city is meticulously planned yet still breathes with nature. Green spaces are not just “added in,” they’re woven into the very fabric of the urban environment — from vast parks to rooftop gardens and tree-lined streets.

Each district has its own flavor: Marina Bay is sleek and futuristic, Arab Street is a burst of color and culture, while Gardens by the Bay feels like stepping into a dream where technology and nature intertwine.

2. Singapore at Night – Where the City Truly Shines

If Singapore in the daytime is a pristine canvas, then nighttime turns it into a masterpiece. As the sun sets, the city transforms — illuminated by thousands of lights that reflect off glass towers and gentle waterways.

Key landmarks like Marina Bay Sands, Clarke Quay, Helix Bridge, and the lotus-shaped ArtScience Museum light up in ways that feel almost cinematic. Walking along the Singapore River at night, you can’t help but slow down — not from tiredness, but from awe. The “Spectra” light and water show at Marina Bay isn’t just a spectacle — it’s a moment that stays with you.

3. The Rhythm of Life – Energetic, Yet Graceful

Despite being a hub of finance, tech, and tourism, Singapore doesn’t feel overwhelming. People move quickly, but not anxiously. The city runs with purpose but still feels respectful, clean, and kind.

There’s a deep sense of order and mindfulness in how locals interact with public spaces — how they queue, how they keep the streets spotless, how they balance modern life with cultural roots. It's a quiet discipline that leaves a lasting impression.","2 months ago on

Brett Chua (ERA 93383387),5/5,"The only hotel I would gladly stay in Singapore. My last visit was superb! I wanted an earlier check in as i wasnt feeling well, and therefore took what was available on a low floor. However, as it was on the 3rd floor I could hear constant human traffic and screaming of kids by the lobby. Called up to reception and request for a move to a higher floor, and was treated with much care and concern. My relationship manager took care of it professionally and gave me higher unit almost immediately. Great service and prompt response!","3 weeks ago on

Himanshu Johari,5/5,"We booked a stay at Marina Bay Sands to celebrate my son’s birthday — it was his dream to swim in the infinity pool, and we wanted to make it unforgettable. I booked two suites for our family, kids, and nieces so everyone could be part of the celebration.

The rooms and the pool were simply amazing, and the kids had the time of their lives. But what truly stood out was the exceptional service, especially from Erica, who gave us a check-in experience unlike anything I’ve had before.

We were greeted right at the car and taken directly to our suite, where the kids were welcomed with chocolates and apples. While the little ones ran around, excited and full of joy, my family and I completed the check-in formalities in the comfort of our room — no queues, no waiting, just pure ease.

From start to finish, everything about our stay was thoughtful, seamless, and special. Thank you, Marina Bay Sands, for making my son’s birthday a memory we will cherish forever.","4 weeks ago on

Casey Caswell,5/5,"We had an amazing stay at Marina Bay Sands. The hotel truly lives up to the hype, from the rooftop infinity pool to the great selection of restaurants and beautifully appointed rooms.

We stayed in a family suite, which was perfect for travelling with kids. They loved the space and having access to the babysitting service made a big difference.

Highly recommend for anyone visiting Singapore.","a month ago on

viswesh muralitharan,5/5,"We did not stay here, but visited the roof top of the hotel. The views are amazing and they also have a coffee shop at the roof top to enjoy a sip of coffee and the views. Be there 15 mins before the ticket time to ensure a smooth experience. Also, if there is bad weather, you wouldn’t be allowed to go to the top floor, but would be refunded or choose an another day as per your choice.","a month ago on

Rosh Wang,5/5,"I would opt for 7 stars if possible as staffs are most courteous, able to provide great service and whole place is well kept, grandeur and has good signage everywhere.
Excellent location for businesses, events or simply a relaxing day or evening.
Great for meetings, exhibitions and conventions. Plus also fantastic shopping at the Shoppes with loads of luxury international brands.","a month ago on

S J,4/5,"Marina Bay Sands is truly a symbol of Singapore, and it’s a place I visit every year.

With so many rooms and guests, compared to other hotels of the same class, it doesn’t give the feeling of personalized care while moving around the hotel. However, the service at the lobby and concierge is excellent.

A few years ago, the hotel underwent a major renovation, and the rooms have been updated to a higher standard, which I’m really happy with. Since COVID, hotel prices in Singapore have risen across the board, and Marina Bay Sands is no exception. It’s now hard to find a room for under $700 a night.

Still, the signature infinity pool is something you just can’t miss :) I often bring guests here, and the growing number of F&B outlets offers a variety of options, which is very satisfying.","2 weeks ago on

Elif Gülsüm Parlak Yolcu,5/5,"The architecture of the hotel and especially the infinity pool are truly impressive. Watching the city from above was breathtaking. Due to weather conditions, we weren’t allowed to enter the pool for about 1–2 hours — the wait was a bit frustrating, but overall the experience was fantastic. The room was comfortable, the staff was attentive, and the restaurants were excellent. Definitely a hotel we’d love to stay at again and again.","2 months ago on

Ricobald,5/5,"We stayed at the MBS for 2 nights. It was an unforgettable experience: the rooms are very spacious and clean, with the beds being absolutely perfect. Of course, the infinity pool was the highlight for the whole family, but so were the light shows in the Garden and the Bay. The quick check-out was perfect since we had little time on the day of departure. Unfortunately, on the day of arrival, only one of the two booked rooms was ready, which is not ideal after a 14-hour flight when all you want to do is rest. But overall, the hotel is definitely worth the trip!","Edited 3 weeks ago on

Marex Cad,5/5,"Staying at Marina Bay Sands was truly a dream come true! From the moment I stepped into the lobby, I was blown away by the sheer elegance and attention to detail, the grand space, the warm lighting, and the stunning arrangements of pink lilies that filled the air with the most amazing fragrance. It set the tone for an unforgettable stay.

The service was beyond exceptional. Every staff member I met was warm, professional, and genuinely eager to make my experience perfect. The room was a sanctuary, spacious, spotless, and boasting breathtaking views of the Singapore skyline. The bed was so comfortable, it felt like sleeping on a cloud, and every amenity was thoughtfully provided.

And then, the infinity pool… absolutely surreal! Swimming above the city, watching the sunset paint the skyline in gold and pink hues, was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. It felt like pure magic.

The location couldn’t be better, with easy access to everything Singapore has to offer. From start to finish, everything was flawless. This wasn’t just a stay; it was a memory I’ll cherish forever. Marina Bay Sands isn’t just a hotel, it’s an experience of a lifetime!!

If you’re considering it, don’t think twice. Absolute perfection! I can’t wait to return.","a month ago on

Nabil Ruslan,5/5,"I stayed in the Sands Bay Suite King with the Gardens by the Bay view, and it was pure luxury from start to finish. The suite was spacious and elegantly designed. The stunning view of the Gardens, especially when the Supertrees light up at night, added a magical touch. The bathroom was like a private spa, featuring a  luxurious Jo Malone amenities. The bed was incredibly comfortable, and the walk-in wardrobe was a nice luxurious bonus. Being right in the heart of the city during the F1 weekend made the stay even more exciting, watching the city come alive with the race vibes was unforgettable. The rooftop infinity pool was breathtaking — swimming there with the city skyline all around felt like something out of a dream. The rooftop bar was the perfect place to enjoy premium drinks while soaking up spectacular views. With impeccable service and exclusive access to The Club, the whole stay was a truly luxurious experience. Definitely one of the best and most memorable hotel stays I’ve ever had.","3 months ago on

Kim Tey,5/5,"Iconic and Luxurious Experience!

Marina Bay Sands is an absolute gem in Singapore! The hotel, the infinity pool, and the observation deck – everything is top-notch. The view from the SkyPark is breathtaking, especially at sunset or night when the whole city lights up. The infinity pool on the 57th floor? Totally worth the hype – you feel like you're swimming in the sky.

The shopping mall downstairs is full of high-end brands, and the dining options are fantastic – perfect if you’re looking for something a bit fancy. The whole complex feels so luxurious and is a great spot to take photos.

Even if you're not staying at the hotel, visiting the observation deck or enjoying the rooftop is a must-do when in Singapore.","2 months ago on

Michael Mokaya Rasugu,5/5,Visited the  shopping mall & 57th Floor SPAGO Restaurant. Amazing views from the top! The SPAGO Rooftop restaurant in the middle Tower 2 isn’t all that in views and service. The panoramic view is blocked off for in-house residents who use the pool and the service can be quite slow during peak times. Still had a great time though! Carry enough money as its not as cheap either!,"2 months ago on

Tarun Yadav,5/5,"I stayed here in a suite for 3 nights, 21st June-24th June; family of 5. We all thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. Staff was helpful and efficient - both at check-in and accommodating of a 75year old disabled grandmother. Only mild complaint was some of the quality of the food at RISE for buffets - there is a lot of options, but a lot of it isnt world class that you'd expect. Other mild complaint is gym. It's a good 5-10 min walk away near the expo centre - while all the cardio equipment is new, the gym is TINY. If you go at peak times, you have to wait for dumbbells etc. Otherwise, all in all, it is a luxury hotel with great dining options and entertainment in a great location. RECOMMEND.","2 months ago on

Pulok Reberio,5/5,"Marina Bay Sands is not just a hotel — it's an experience.

From the moment you walk into the grand lobby, you're treated to luxury, modern elegance, and world-class service. The iconic three-tower structure connected by the SkyPark is an architectural marvel and a symbol of Singapore itself.

🌟 Highlights:

✅ Infinity Pool – The rooftop infinity pool on the 57th floor is everything it’s hyped up to be. The view of Singapore’s skyline while floating in the pool is unforgettable and perfect for photos. (Note: pool access is for hotel guests only.)

✅ Location – Perfectly located at Marina Bay with direct access to Gardens by the Bay, the ArtScience Museum, and The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands. Everything is walkable or connected via MRT.

✅ Rooms – Spacious, clean, and luxuriously comfortable. Floor-to-ceiling windows offer stunning city or bay views. Bathrooms are high-end and well-stocked.

✅ Dining – From celebrity chef restaurants (Gordon Ramsay, Wolfgang Puck, etc.) to food courts and local cuisine, there’s something for every palate and budget.

✅ Shopping & Entertainment – Endless luxury shopping, live shows, the casino, and even Sampan rides indoors! It's impossible to be bored.

✅ Staff & Service – Professional, friendly, and attentive. Check-in and check-out are smooth even when the hotel is busy.","2 months ago on

Walking distance to many of Singapores iconic locations and plenty to keep the family busy

A convenient casino just steps away

Julie Kay Hoyle,4/5,"It was a surreal experience, which was good. It is expensive to dine within the hotel at various venues. Drinks were very expensive too. A buffet breakfast was included, but oh my goodness, it was extremely busy no matter what time we attended. One day, there were over 70 people in the queue waiting to be seated. We sent an email to the hotel, as one day, our allocated table was next to a door for anyone to go outside into the garden dining area. This particular breakfast wasn't enjoyable as it was a constant thoroughfare with so many other guests squeezing past. We received a phone call within a few minutes of sending our email. They understood our issue but didn't offer any solution. We weren't offered this table again 🙏 The said table was still in place the following day! We also sadly noticed the huge amount of food being wasted from a lot of guests.
We had a couple of issues having to wait, one was for some wine we had ordered for our room, we eventually after almost an hour of waiting received a call to advise the wine wasn't available!
The room itself was lovely & the views were beautiful. Overall the staff were extremely polite & very helpful.
The main thoroughfare near to reception is extremely busy, with anyone being able to access not just guests staying at the hotel as the shopping mall/cinema/casino/restaurants, etc, are accessible from here.
We do hope the infrastructure is being carefully considered whilst Tower 4 is being constructed, as the number of people moving through & around is extremely busy!!
The infinity pool was amazing though & enjoyable 😎","5 months ago on

Doraemon,5/5,"To celebrate Kitty's birthday, I treated us to a suite at the iconic Marina Bay Sands, and it was an absolutely unforgettable experience. Knowing the suite was a significant investment, we decided to maximize our time indulging in the luxurious amenities and breathtaking views from our room. While we did venture out, we primarily focused on enjoying the comfort and elegance of our suite, interspersed with a special dinner at the Paiza Sky Residence.

The suite itself was incredibly spacious and elegantly appointed, offering stunning panoramic views of the city skyline and Marina Bay. Kitty particularly loved the sheer size of the room, commenting on how much space there was to relax and unwind. The luxurious bedding and amenities were top-notch, but what truly impressed her was the luxurious bathroom. The enormous bathtub with a built-in jacuzzi was a standout feature, and the in-built bathroom TV added an extra touch of luxury.  She spent a considerable amount of time luxuriating in the tub, enjoying the jets and the in-bathroom entertainment.  We also made use of the in-room karaoke system (KTV), enjoying a fun and relaxing night of singing.

Our dinner at the Paiza Sky Residence was, without a doubt, a highlight. The service was impeccable, the food exquisite, and the ambience sophisticated and elegant. The panoramic views from the Sky Residence were equally stunning, offering a different perspective on the city skyline compared to our suite.

Even the little details were impressive. Kitty particularly enjoyed the high-quality toiletries provided. The  body lotion, hair shampoo, and conditioner all smelled divine. The complimentary drinks and fresh fruit in the room were a welcome touch. Everything was immaculately clean and seamlessly arranged, adding to the overall luxurious experience.

While we did briefly explore The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands and the SkyPark Observation Deck having a short swin at the infinity pool, the majority of our stay was spent luxuriating in our suite and enjoying the exceptional dining experience at the Sky Residence. It was a splurge, but for a special occasion like Kitty's birthday, it was absolutely worth it.","2 months ago on

However, an impressive architectural wonder is nothing without the famous Singaporean hospitality, which you see on Singapore Airlines.

My wife has wanted to swim in the rooftop pool here since seeing it on the Crazy Rich Asians movie. Only guests are allowed to use the pool, so an extra shift at work paid for our stay

It reminds me of the giant Vegas mega hotels with massive corridors, high end shopping and a casino. You won’t run out of of things to do with many other attractions on your doorstep. Don’t miss the free dancing fountains show","a month ago on

Thang Nguyen,5/5,"If you’re visiting Singapore and looking for an unforgettable experience, Marina Bay Sands is the place to be. From the moment you step inside, it’s clear why this hotel is one of the most iconic landmarks in the world.

The architecture alone is a marvel — three soaring towers connected by the breathtaking SkyPark, which offers panoramic views of the city skyline and Marina Bay. The infinity pool on the rooftop is perhaps the most famous in the world, and swimming there feels like floating above the city.

Rooms are spacious, modern, and impeccably maintained, with floor-to-ceiling windows that bring the stunning skyline right into your suite. The service is top-tier, blending warmth and professionalism in true Singaporean fashion.

What makes Marina Bay Sands truly unique is its integration with luxury retail, entertainment, and dining. The hotel is connected to a high-end shopping mall featuring the most prestigious brands globally — Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Dior, and more — along with a curated selection of fine dining from celebrity chefs like Gordon Ramsay and Wolfgang Puck.

The casino, ArtScience Museum, and regular light shows at the Spectra waterfront add even more dimension to your stay, whether you’re here for business or leisure","a month ago on

Alex Y.N.A,1/5,"Thanks guys. You guys don’t even take care of your workers- a relative of mine who has been working for your company as a cleaner for almost 8 years has just been told by his supervisor that because he’s “sick” which he isn’t, he was told he had no job when he turned up to work, and not even given a formal letter of termination. He was told that he would be contacted by HR on Monday which is astonishing. We’ve contacted your front desk and from what we’ve been told, HR is on it but we don’t know when we’ll be called. We have contacted MOM about this because the situation is beyond unfair- this is a man who’s elderly and who is getting his eye fixed. He’s not blind or sick. This smacks of unfair termination, and his supervisor should’ve gone through the right channels and or tried to help him. He knows that his only issue is his diabetes which doesn’t make him ill. Well, we hope that the Hr will get back as soon as possible. Either way, we have contacted MOM about this unfair treatment and we hope that this issue can be solved soon. Imagine doing this to an elderly person who has worked hard for your company for ages, is always early and makes sure he’s on time. This is awful.","3 months ago on

Jie Bo Ti,5/5,"Perhaps my favourite memory of this place was having a nice afternoon tea with my mother on the 55th floor. We were overlooking the city skyline and she was pointed out the changes to the Singaporean skyline.
You could tell how proud she was and how proud LKY and the pioneer generation must be to see the progress they've made.
MBS really do hold a special place in the mind if every Singaporean above a certain age. Because once there was nothing, something extraordinary came in its place.","2 months ago on

Phineas Flynn,5/5,"Marina Bay Sands is without a doubt one of the most iconic landmarks in Singapore, offering a luxurious experience from start to finish. The architecture alone is breathtaking—three towers connected by the famous SkyPark, which offers stunning panoramic views of the city skyline, Marina Bay, and beyond.

The Infinity Pool on the rooftop is world-famous and truly lives up to the hype. It’s only accessible to hotel guests, but if you get the chance to stay, it’s worth it for that view alone. There’s also a public observation deck if you're not staying at the hotel.

Inside, MBS features a high-end shopping mall with luxury brands, a canal with gondola rides, and a wide variety of restaurants—from celebrity chef fine dining to local delicacies. The ArtScience Museum and nightly Spectra light and water show at the promenade are great additions that make it a complete entertainment destination.

It’s directly connected to Gardens by the Bay via a beautiful pedestrian bridge, and the Bayfront MRT station is just below the complex, making it super accessible.

Whether you're staying the night, coming for a show, or just enjoying the views, Marina Bay Sands offers a world-class experience in the heart of Singapore.","a month ago on

Thanawat Silanon,5/5,"The most luxurious shopping mall I’ve ever been to. It includes the world’s first floating Apple Store and the world’s first Louis Vuitton Island Maison.

Easily accessible via Bayfront MRT station, the mall is huge, extremely clean, and well-maintained.

The signage in the mall is clear and easy to understand, making it simple to find your way around. There are many tourists, yet it doesn’t feel crowded because of how spacious the mall is.

The mall also has clean and modern restrooms and well-planned escalators for easy movement between floors.

It features a luxury hotel and was deemed the world’s most expensive standalone casino property in 2010 — though I didn’t have the chance to experience those myself.

Overall, it’s an impressive and unique shopping destination that combines luxury, convenience, and thoughtful design — definitely worth a visit even if you’re just exploring.","3 months ago on

M7 P7,5/5,"First visit to Singapore. Spent 3 nights in a Paiza family suite to get over our jet-lag before heading to Indonesia to see family. Really exceptional property and service. We live in Las Vegas and MBS really one-ups any property on the strip with regards to service and amenities available. Felt it was the perfect base to explore Singapore. Five to 7 days would have been more ideal. Concierge was amazing working with me before arrival to create a great itinerary and were even able to help with some goodies in the room for arrival and replacing some last minute items I forgot at home. Will be back, next time for longer.","a month ago on

Marius,5/5,"For such a massive mega-hotel, the Marina Bay Sands executes quite flawlessly.  The room was beautiful and has some of the most impressive latest technology and the service is truly quite amazing.  And of course  - the rooftop infinity pool is one of a kind in this world.

We were fortunate enough to stay at the room facing Gardens by the bay with a large walk-out balcony. While the room was quite small, it was jam-packed with all kinds of tech features that even blow the Japanese hotels away.

The  service was absolutely remarkable. Any need was fulfilled within 10 mins or less from the call, and the staff truly cared about ones comfort.

The breakfast had the ""quantity over quality"" feel to it. As to be expected,  the spread was quite massive, with quite massive crowds to boot. Best to go before 08:30am to avoid any lines.

Of course, the rooftop infinity pool is a 10/10. Incredible in every way, a true modern marvel. We visited several times through several days and even at night and found plenty of loungers available. Staff was there to provide quick drink and snack service as well.

Overall , I was left impressed with the MBS. The room was impeccably clean and showed zero signs of wear. Its quite impressive how such a large enterprise can keep the service level so high. And the service was amazing, but one does feel a bit like a number based on the size of the hotel. Would definitely stay here again.","7 months ago on

Benedict Correya,5/5,"An iconic landmark of Singapore and a must-visit destination. The architecture itself is breathtaking, and the views from the SkyPark Observation Deck are absolutely stunning—especially at sunset when the city skyline lights up. The infinity pool at the top is world-famous, and for good reason, offering one of the most unique swimming experiences in the world.

Inside, Marina Bay Sands offers everything under one roof: a luxury shopping mall with high-end brands, a wide range of restaurants (from celebrity chefs to casual dining), a casino, and even a museum. The Spectra light and water show at night by the bay is a highlight not to be missed—free and beautifully choreographed.

While it is on the pricier side, the experience is unmatched and worth it at least once. A true symbol of modern Singapore.","Edited 3 weeks ago on

Tushar Shah,4/5,For a World Class Hotel I feel it was only worthy of four stars. I have stayed in hotels of this level and found them to be worthy of 5 stars. For MBS I felt more could be done towards the guests. For example the Rise restaurant where you have your breakfast and hight teas just seem basic. The food offered as part of the booking (buffet style) is more likely to be the left overs from A La Carte menu on the other side of the restaurant. I suppose it's food served that is not going to waste!,"6 months ago on

Ras U-Ahk,5/5,"Marina Bay Sands Singapore truly exceeded my expectations during my short stay. The iconic property boasts breathtaking landscapes that immediately transport you to a world of luxury and elegance. While my visit was brief, I was able to immerse myself in the grandeur that Marina Bay Sands is renowned for.

Upon arrival, I regretfully missed the opportunity to dine at their Italian restaurant due to its closing hours. Nevertheless, I was compensated by the exceptional service and warm hospitality extended by the staff, making me feel welcome and valued throughout my stay.

One highlight of my visit was the casino experience, even though I am not a gambling enthusiast. Watching my friend revel in the excitement of the baccarat table was a joy in itself. The refreshing lemonade cucumber tea served at the casino instantly became a favorite, earning the amusing moniker ""hot mountain dew"" from us.

While exploring the expansive mall area, I marveled at the architecture and design surrounding me. The sheer scale of the mall was impressive, filled with an array of stores and amenities that cater to every need and desire. Although I missed the chance to fully indulge in retail therapy due to the late hour, the ambiance alone was enough to leave a lasting impression.

Despite the closing time of most establishments in the mall, we found solace in dining at the exclusive club restaurant. The culinary experience was nothing short of exceptional, offering a delectable array of dishes that tantalized our taste buds and left us craving for more. The impeccable service and attention to detail truly elevated our dining experience to a new level of luxury.

One cannot help but appreciate the intricate beauty and craftsmanship that permeates every corner of Marina Bay Sands. From the lavish decor to the stunning views of the surrounding cityscape, every aspect of the property exudes sophistication and opulence. The meticulous attention to detail is evident in every aspect of the hotel, ensuring a seamless and unforgettable experience for every guest.

The unparalleled views from the observation deck left me in awe of the panoramic vistas that stretched as far as the eye could see. The expansive skyline of Singapore, coupled with the stunning waterfront views, created a mesmerizing backdrop that encapsulated the essence of urban beauty and modernity.

Throughout my stay, I was consistently impressed by the level of service and professionalism displayed by the staff at Marina Bay Sands. Their dedication to ensuring the comfort and satisfaction of guests was commendable, making me feel valued and appreciated at every interaction.

In conclusion, Marina Bay Sands Singapore is a true gem that offers a luxurious and immersive experience like no other. From the exquisite landscapes to the world-class amenities and exceptional service, every aspect of the property is designed to exceed expectations and create lasting memories.

The service was amazing and despite being such a big hotel, I did not feel lost or without attention. There is also a laser light show at the marina bay sands complex at night which was fun.

Sebastian Mitoraj,5/5,"I didn't stay at this hotel but I was there at the viewing point. The building is impressive and the view from the 56th floor, especially at night, is even greater. I highly recommend the Skypark Observation Deck at the top of the hotel. I consider it one of the must-sees when visiting Singapore. It is better to buy tickets one or two days in advance on the official website, especially for the evening hours. It often happens that they are already sold out.

Kunal Taviya,5/5,"A Sky-High Experience with Spectacular Views

We visited hotel’s observation deck. This observation deck offers a panoramic view of the city that is truly breathtaking.

The primary draw of the Marina Bay Sands Observation Deck is, of course, the view. From this vantage point, you get an unobstructed, 360-degree view of Singapore’s stunning skyline, the bustling Marina Bay, and the vast expanse of the sea stretching into the distance. On a clear day, you can see as far as Indonesian lands.

The view encompasses some of Singapore’s most iconic landmarks. You’ll see the lush greenery and futuristic structures of Gardens by the Bay, including the Supertree Grove and the two glass conservatories. The sight of the Marina Bay area from above, including the Merlion, the Esplanade, and the Singapore Flyer, is particularly striking. As the sun sets, the city transitions into a vibrant display of lights, making the evening visit a magical experience. The colors reflecting off the bay and the dazzling city lights make it an ideal spot for photographers.

The Observation Deck itself is expansive, offering plenty of room to move around and take in the views from different angles. Unlike other observation decks that might feel cramped, this one provides ample space for everyone to enjoy the view without feeling crowded, even during peak hours. The deck is designed to ensure safety while providing an open, airy feel.

One of the unique aspects of the deck is its open-air design. Unlike enclosed observation decks with glass barriers, the Marina Bay Sands deck offers an unobstructed view, allowing you to fully immerse yourself in the surroundings. The feeling of standing 57 floors above ground, with the wind in your hair and the city sprawled out beneath you, is exhilarating.

To get the most out of your visit, I recommend timing your trip to coincide with sunset. Arriving about an hour before sunset allows you to experience the transition from day to night. Watching the sun dip below the horizon, casting a warm golden hue over the city, is a moment of pure beauty. As day turns to night, the city’s lights begin to sparkle, creating a mesmerizing scene that’s perfect for capturing on camera.

Another highlight of an evening visit is the nightly Spectra Light and Water Show at Marina Bay Sands. From the Observation Deck, you get a unique, bird’s-eye view of this show, which combines dancing fountains, colorful lights, and music in a spectacular display. The view from above adds an extra dimension to the experience, allowing you to appreciate the choreography of the water jets and lights in their entirety.

The Observation Deck also offers a few additional amenities that enhance the experience. There’s a small bar where you can purchase drinks and snacks, allowing you to relax and enjoy the view with a refreshing beverage in hand.

It’s worth noting that the open-air design means it can get quite hot during the day, so bringing sunscreen and a hat is advisable if you’re visiting earlier in the day.","Edited a year ago on

Lot of people just join in between leaving the line not moving.

I understand the it is common sense but everyone has plans for the day leading them to break and trying to join in between.

This place is so popular now for tourists so they can create a waiting room allowing the tourists to sit and wait when there such a huge crowd","a year ago on

The room (one of the least expensive) is really big with great features and facilities. But the crowning glory is the infinity pool on floor 57. Just breathtaking.

Mohit Singh,5/5,"We stayed 2 nights and had booked bay view room but during checkin process we got upgraded to executive room with city zviewing which due to lack of room that I had booked. The executive room was fab and appeared like bigger than 3 bed flat.  City view from room and lounge area was amazing. Room was on 45th floor. Hi Tech touch panel everywhere to control lights, curtains and AC. Fully automatic smart toilet with touch panel, what a luxury !! Jacuzzi, 12 point shower panel, 2 wash basin in bathroom and a tv in front of bath. Separate dressing area, dining area, bar area, lounge area with 6 seater sofa having 75 inch TV. It was fab. Only thing I didnt like was the big queue for breakfast. This hotel is super expensive and seeing guests standing in a long queue was no pleasure at all. Then, though we were upgraded to executive room but were denied breakfast since it wasnt part of my original booking but executive suits cones with by default breakfast. Its like getting upgraded to business class from economy class but cabin crew serving you food of economy class which is rare or I have never heard of. Singapore is heaven for food and we wanted to explore local food hence it wasnt an issue at all but this is something MBS management shoul look into and consider my airlones analogy. Infinity pool, observation deck was easily accessible.","10 months ago on

Home to the world's largest rooftop infinity pool with incredible city views.  Several restaurants to choose from to satisfy every palette.  There is much to do here, even if you aren't a hotel guest.  Make sure this place is visited when in Singapore.","2 years ago on

Food- better than what we had everywhere else in the city but we didn't visit a lot of high end restaurants to compare. Ce La Vi is worth for the view! Make sure you have reservations.
Service - it is a hit or miss- at times you feel pampered and cared for, at times ignored.
Give yourself some time to eat from one place to another. The towers are quite massive and it takes some time to figure out and get from one point to the next. Definitely try the pool- an insta opportunity!
Is it worth the hype - absolutely (especially at night).
Is it worth the big price tag?-mmmm, not so sure!","a year ago on

The pool is amazing, I did not think I would be that amazed but I was speechless once in it. The pool has a booking system of an hour and 15 minutes. We felt that it was very well organized by the whole staff considering the pandemic. At least it wasn't crowded at all. :) We tried the gym, too.

Gardens by the Bay, as well as the city centre. The connected hotel buildings and the associated function and shopping venues are landmarks for Singapore. The hotel room was recently upgraded and has a great view of the garden (you can choose the city side too). It's got great services taken care of by the service teams, from filling up the bathroom amenities to booking a taxi for you, and immediately upon arrival - a warm (refreshing rather as it's pretty hot in Singapore already) welcome from the moment the taxi stops at the drop-off zone. The hotel has a great roof top pool with infinity edge, which is accessible to all guests through a transfer of lift. The hotel room felt luxurious - not my favourite style but every detail in the bathroom to the balcony was well considered. Highly recommended!","a year ago on

Thought check-out was at 12 but it was 11, but they kindly offered us an hour extension.

Vũ Hải Nam,5/5,"My trip to Marina Bay Sands was nothing short of spectacular, and I can't wait to share my experience with you. This iconic destination in Singapore is truly a marvel.

First off, the architecture is jaw-dropping. The three towering buildings connected by that massive rooftop deck, which includes the famous infinity pool, are a testament to human engineering at its finest. As soon as I arrived, I was in awe of the sheer scale and design of this place.

Now, let's talk about the shopping. The mall inside Marina Bay Sands is a shopper's paradise. You'll find all the high-end brands you can think of, and if you're a fan of luxury shopping, this is the place to be.

But the real star of the show is the view. From the rooftop deck, you get an unparalleled panoramic view of the Singapore skyline. I recommend going up there during sunset – the sight is simply breathtaking. And don't forget your camera because you'll want to capture every moment.

Now, onto the services. They are top-notch, just as you'd expect from such a renowned destination. The staff is incredibly friendly and always ready to assist with a smile. I felt well taken care of during my entire visit.

For those planning a visit, here are some tips. Aim to visit in the evening to catch the mesmerizing light show. Check the weather forecast because Singapore can surprise you with sudden rain. And budget accordingly, as Marina Bay Sands offers a plethora of experiences, and you'll want to make the most of your time here.

In terms of improvements, it's hard to find fault, but perhaps more affordable dining options could make the experience even more accessible to a wider range of visitors.

In conclusion, Marina Bay Sands is a must-visit destination in Singapore. It combines stunning architecture, world-class shopping, and breathtaking views into an unforgettable experience. So, if you find yourself in Singapore, make sure to put this gem on your itinerary – you won't be disappointed!","a year ago on

Eric Dao,5/5,"A very large hotel! Has 3 towers and over 2000 rooms, along with a nice rooftop infinity pool. Access to many different things within  distance,l including a large expo centre, gardens, luxury shops, casino, food court, restaurants, subway station and two rooftop bars, it offers a lot and is accessible to a lot for a large range of customers.

The rooms were nice, but I wasn't wow'd by them as the room itself was fairly basic but the amenities were nice. The magic really does lie within how it seems to be a central hub with a lot of venues / things to do around it.","2 years ago on

Geoff Jones,3/5,"The one redeeming feature is the 70m rooftop pool. Otherwise it’s a way over priced 3* hotel. Huge queues at check in very little porterage, mediocre room given its huge nightly rate, poor shower with no flexible hose so impossible to wash your privates annoying no bidet spray either. If walking you have to go underground to get out of the hotel. Remember in Singapore the car is king!

It is a one of a kind and if you have the ability to splurge, stay a night here.  You won't regret it.","2 years ago on

But around merlion you can also trying to enjoy the time over there, bought an ice cream (I forgot the name) coconut and strawberry was delicious flavour.

Suresh Kumar,5/5,"Marina Bay Sands is a stunning building with plenty of shops available, although the costs can be quite high. It’s easy to reach the Gardens by the Bay, Sky Tower, Flower Dome, and Cloud Forest from there. Inside the building, there’s a casino. For foreigners, there’s no entry fee and complimentary drinks, while locals need to pay an entry fee. It’s advisable to avoid playing the games.

A full day is needed to see the tourist attractions in Marina Bay and nearby areas. Most of these attractions require an entry fee, which can be quite expensive.","a year ago on

Tom Luo,4/5,"Everything about MBS is as expected so 5*. At the same time, there is nothing ‘special’ about the place. You get what you pay for. Some may find it cold and almost too clinical in its execution. It’s one of those ‘must stay’ hotels for tourists coming to Singapore.

I would personally recommend the Fullerton or Fullerton Bay across the river. Smaller hotels but just as good. And you actually get a view of MBS which is the main attraction.","a year ago on

It’s nice to be able to trace the Grand Prix track but for the money it’s pretty basic.

There isn’t any seating up there which to me shows that they just want you up and down fairly quickly so they can make more money out of everyone.

If you want really excellent views I’d suggest you book a table on the balcony at level33 around sunset.","2 years ago on

Cobby Clan,5/5,"Iconic. This is the only way to describe this hotel. We arrived at 9.30am and yet they still checked us in, allowed us our room and were friendly and inviting. We are in room 3622 (36th floor,  room 22)

The cases were brought to the room within 15 minutes as promised, and the bed (for my 16 year old) arrived and was set up within 30 minutes.

You can arrange everything from the app and the large TV.

The room overlooked the gardens and bay as requested.

The room was large, had tea and coffee machines, a pre stocked and free mini fridge, and snack drawer.

The bathroom had a full set of amenities e.g. shower gel, shampoo, conditioner, tissues, dental kit etc. There were slippers and bath robes, which I noticed people also used around the pool.

The lifts are activated by swiping your room key card before selecting your floor. The room key card is also required to access the infinity pool on the roof, which also allocates you a towel.

The pool is amazing. It is warm and has the most amazing views across the river to Singapore, including the Merlion. The food is amazing. You can sit around the pool with anything from squid sushi rolls to burger and fries (both of which are delicious).

Whilst the pool is only open to hotel guests the observation deck is open to the public.

There is nothing to dislike about this experience. Well worth the stay. The last thing to mention is the staff, every one has been brilliant, friendly and charming.","2 years ago on

Had the opportunity to stay at the city view and the garden/ocean view. I love the sea so i would always prefer the latter.  Things to note during the Covid-19 phase. They do not mention this when ur booking the stay but they do inform u at the receptionist that in order to enter the infinity pool either to enjoy it or just walk around, you need to book a slot. Its an hr slot for each time ur book. And its limited. Due to they capped it at only 50-100pax at each slot. My advice is u book it when checking in. If u manage to get a slot, it will be fabulous.  The pool is basically empty due to everyone is spreaded apart. My kids had a good time since there were more space for them to play . ◡̈","5 years ago on

Alem Moto,5/5,"If I could give the hotel 10 stars I would. Besides the obvious hype of the infinity pool it is important to remark that the staff is friendly, professional and helpful. The hotel itself is gorgeous with great food options, tons of stuff to do around and the pool…The pool is otherworldly. The general experience is worth every cent and the quality is the same of much more expensive places. I would definitely come back to Singapore only to stay here again. One of the best hotels in the world in my humble opinion.","3 years ago on

Viviana Mucharraz,4/5,"Imcredible views from there, but paying the ticket to go at the top is the worst waste of money. Make sure you book instead a place at the Sky Bar or one of the restaurants, you end up spending almost the same as if you buy the tickets but with a much better experience than walking under the sun next to a bunch of sweaty people eating popcorn in the floor.","2 years ago on

Björn F.,5/5,"The Marina Bay Sands stands out with its beautiful architecture. The building has an extreme charisma when it comes to its architecture. The restaurants which are located in the hotel are very expensive but inexpensive. The food is really first class and offers something for everyone. The security staff at the hotel is very courteous and friendly. The infinity pool and the visitors terrace offer a wonderful view over the whole city of Singapore. The panorama is just incredible. The infinity pool on the top floor is always very felt, and should therefore be visited early in the morning when the pool opens, or late in the evening when it closes. The rooms are very clean, the bathroom was very spacious and the view is of course incredible over Marina Bay.","4 years ago on

There's absolutely zero complaints about this hotel.  Of course, because of the surroundings everything's a little pricey, but what do you expect.?? There's a club located in the mall called marquee which is amazing, one of the best clubs in the world I would say.

If you’re visiting Singapore you must take at least one night to experience the hotel.
The hotel is well equipped, there is a gym and spa and casino and a whole new level of shopping experience. Oh and of course the tallest pool in the world (57th floor).
The staff is really nice and helpful.
The views from the pool deck (which is exclusive for hotel guests) is just incomparable. Spent hours there, day and night. The views are just addicting.
There is an MRT station right under the hotel (literally beneath it) so it’s so easy to get by.
The hotel is built from 3 buildings, which are huge, so take a little time to learn how to navigate through this huge complex.
The hotel is a bit pricey but it’s just so worth it.

Scott,3/5,"Not worth the cost $3,800USD for 2 rooms for 2 nights. 1 of 2 rooms wasn’t ready for 1.5 hours after guaranteed checkin time and was full of cigarette smoke. They attempted to say they will “clean” it somehow as they said they were fully booked which we refused as our kids were staying there. After some arguing they agreed to find another room which they did. Not sure how as they previously said they were booked. Later that evening we got stuck unable to use elevators from pool when all our keys became disabled including our 1st room. By 8pm we finally had 2 rooms. This is after arriving at 1pm. Really disappointing for a hotel demanding such a high price.

While amazing views and experience from rooftop pool, I would never stay there again. Wasn’t worth it even with the frustration.","Edited 2 years ago on

After some arguing they agreed to find another room which they did. Not sure how as they previously said they were booked. Later that evening we got stuck unable to use elevators from pool when all our keys became disabled including our 1st room. By 8pm we finally had 2 rooms. This is after arriving at 1pm. Really disappointing for a hotel demanding such a high price.

While amazing views and experience from rooftop pool, I would never stay there again. Wasn’t worth it even with the frustration."
Ben Greenbaum,4/5,"Great service, amazing architecture, beautiful location near most of the most interesting parts of Singapore, outstanding rooftop pool and bars, mediocre rooms for the price and don't expect to eat anywhere in the resort complex without reservations unless you jostle for seating in the mall food court. I'm glad I stayed here and I recommend it at least once but I'm not sure I will again.","3 years ago on

The hotel is made with beautiful materials and has a wonderful ambience generated by the amazing flowers, trees, water features and chilled out music. The rooms are superb.

kakajulia,2/5,"Definitely an overpriced place, the facility is outdated and the overall management is poorly designed. If you are there for casino and infinity pool this might be the place for you, but if you are there for leisure and holiday (like us), you might be ended up with huge disappointment. The hotel has no walk-in capacity for stay in guests at any bar/lounge, everything need to be booked in advance. We were planned to stay there for 3 nights but couldn’t find a place for a casual drink at any bar/lounge. The staff there was very friendly and managed to help us made a reservation at one of its bar, but there is a dress code which doesn’t allow any guests entry with slippers and shorts. (For god’s sake we just wanted to have a couple of drinks at the bar, who would wear a formal suit on the holiday with the temperature is around 33 degree Celsius)

I gave 2 star only to the staff there, they are very well trained and friendly. Overall a horrible experience. There are plenty of good 5 stars hotel in Singapore which have better facility/service. For the amount of money I have paid, the experience is not even close to expectations. I would never return there.","3 years ago on

Danielle F,2/5,"What you’re really paying for when you stay here is to swim in the infinity pool, which is amazing!!! 5 stars for the pool and the pool staff.
BUT everything else is so average (plenty of much nicer accommodation on the island) and check in is painful. It took almost half an hour once I got to the front of the line and then I was told my room wasn’t ready and wouldn’t be for “maybe an hour” - this was at 3:30pm. You are paying a grand a night for that room, you would expect your room to be ready by the usual 3pm time. Luckily I asked if we could go up and use the pool until we had our room which they allowed and were nice about but they didn’t offer that up front. The staff are really nice but the hotel seems to have some strange and very strict processes which makes the stay feel really not holiday-yee. We loved the pool and staff but Otherwise the feel of the place wasn’t enjoyable. We hoped the experience for the price would be better!!
Must say they were helpful with storing luggage though!","3 years ago on

Nick Severson,5/5,"Where to begin. The hotel and surrounding grounds are incredibly beautiful. The services, accommodations, and rooms are wonderful.

The check in process is quite thorough and took almost 40mins, there is a lot to cover!

When our flight was pushed due to a visa issue, Alex at the front desk allowed me to quickly check in to a last minute room and he upgraded us to a beautiful suite. Thank you so much, it made that rough time so much better for us!

Overall an absolute must-stay in our book.","3 years ago on

But every other aspect of the hotel is simply spectacular.

Although the room looks little bit classic or older, fantastic service I've received made me enough satisfied to enjoy perfectly my stay.

Because it is very close to the Gardens by the Bay, shopping mall and other tourism places, highly recommended to try longer as much as possible.

* In case of the pool on the rooftop, it would be much better if it can be switched to warm water  seasonably;^^","2 years ago on

Maxim Mineev,4/5,"Liked - Obviously location, it is still the best. You are coming there for a great downtown view either from your room or from the rooftop pool. The pool is amazing but it is usually overcrowded and you have to spend time to find a spare sun bed.

Disliked · The rest a part from the above. The hotel is overpriced and we were not receiving that level of comfort that you could receive in any of 5* hotels near by. The room equipment was very weak and old, the free mini bar looked like a joke when you are paying 700$ per night. There were no bath in the bathroom.
We had a huge room but it looked empty, they might have added 2 armchairs in front of the window to enjoy the view, but it was not there.
It looked like very simple things were missing.
The hotel is undergoing renovation now and it looks like it will be even more expensive.","2 years ago on

Our room on the 49th floor was spectacular with a view over the gardens, the cloud forest and the harbour.

The staff are absolutely wonderful and tentative to our needs. The infinity pool is definitely worth it. Make sure you got is early to get a good spot by the pool. The hotel is kept extremely clean but definitely feels dated. In order to maintain their luxury feel, the place needs a revamp.","5 years ago on

Caleb Sanchez,5/5,"A luxury mall with tons of stores and fancy restaurants. Don't be like us and miss out on the amazing food court. It's definitely a more affordable side of the mall that includes tons of smaller food stalls at better prices. Similar to a standard hawker centre, you can grab food from different spots and bring them back to the table and share. Just be warned, it's a very popular area so it's usually packed and sometimes difficult to find an open table, especially during lunch/dinner times. But there's lots of very tasty food and incredible teas and drinks.","3 years ago on

While it tends to be pricier compared with other 5 star hotels in Singapore, you get a lot of value for your money - easy access to Gardens by the Bay, top quality shopping and dining experiences, great taxi and subway connections. Breakfast is superb with plenty of options. The skypool is a truly memorable experience and most definitely worth it.

Valentina ch,4/5,"Visiting Singapore with the family, we wanted to try out the famous Marina Bay Sands. Because our son just turned 12 few days before our check-in, we were told the room we booked was not sufficient for the 4 of us due to fire safety regulations. 12 years is considered adult. So we were offered a room that was 3 times more than the reservation we made. Which did not really fit into our budget. After waiting a little bit longer around the lobby, they found a solution that was more acceptable and finally - we checked in! The room was on the 46th floor - really nice view to the Harbor. The only cons I could find were - no toilet bidet and the pillows - way too big and uncomfortable. We did have an incident right next to our room- 3 am in the morning we were woken up by loud screams and crying on the hallway. Really scared us and the kids. But overall a nice experience that we wanted to try - the swimming pool and the breakfast were amazing!","2 years ago on

Will never get tired of it. Plenty of wine and dine which would take you months just to try out every place, both economical to the very exquisite. Loved the service and smile of everyone that serves us. Genuinely good service and positive attitude be it cleaners or the concierge. My partner and I had a memorable stay at this 5 star accomodation. Definition of a landmark location for any tourist.","2 years ago on

However, you should be prepared for the fact that it can also be quite tiring. The sheer size of the complex means there is a lot of ground to cover, and the lack of available seating areas can make it difficult to take a break and rest tired feet.

Jambay D,5/5,"It does leave up to its name and expectations. Definition of luxury indeed. We stayed at the 37 floor with both garden and harbour view. Breathtaking scenery from the balcony. The room was cavernous and we got one without bathtub as it was a promotional offer. The rise restaurant was also huge and great menu on the list. The entry to the swimming pool was staggered and we could use 1 hr daily which was lovely and again the scene from atop was just beautiful.

Would love to come again if there is another promotional offer..lol!","5 years ago on

Kelly Davis,3/5,"The location is great. The pool access is key, but it’s crowded day and night with people taking pictures. Our last night I was hoping to take my daughter for a cocktail, but the bars were all rented out/booked and was told to use in-room dining. After calling and being on hold 30+ minutes was told it would be 75+ minutes for a cocktail to be delivered to the room. Huge disappointment!!! I do NOT recommend booking this hotel except for one night (for the pool pic) - other than that pick a hotel that has time and care for their customers. This was like a bad Disney experience.","2 years ago on

The environment was so cozy that even if there came a huge number of visitors and shoppers, you wound not feel any crowded.

Can you believe there is even a manmade river at the bottom floor that you can enjoy an interesting little sailing for a tiny bit of cost? The food court was always busy and crowded though.

Matthieu MARY,5/5,"Such a stay!

The rooms are well designed, and the beds are comfortable. You can add an extra bed for a couple of hundred SG$ if you travel in family. They are comfortable too.
The room service delivers in less than 30 min at 9 PM. It's tasty.

There is no alcohol in the mini bar, but everything is free and refills every day.

The WiFi is very easy to access but not available when you are in your balcony and the windows are closed. Very reliable and fast enough to do everything  you want.

When you are on the balcony in a garden room, the road is a bit noisy. But when you close the windows, you can't hear quite nothing.

Between levels 10th to 20th in the garden side, you'll access twice per night to the gardens by the bay show directly from your room. Very pleasant.

There is a SMRT station in the mole next to the hotel.

There is a supermarket in this mole.

We went 3 or 4 times (morning, afternoon, evening) in the swimming pool and never had to wait: there were always plenty of free spaces.

Easy checkout. (Less than 2 min).

Bad points:
- WiFi not available on balcony
- road noise on the garden side in the lower levels
- 1st price wine in the room service which could be better.
- would love not finding the lights turned on after every room service.","2 years ago on

Baxby,3/5,"It’s a nice hotel with a steep price tag.  Checking in was chaotic.  People seemed loss where to go.  I noticed 2 guys in suits carrying iPads but they would occasionally disappear.  Waiting for your turn to check in is a lengthy process. You can hardly read the number on the iPad showing which customer number is being serviced if you are a few feet away so people wander back and forth to check.  Not a very restful scene to see after a long day of travel. The iconic rooftop pool is a nice feature but gets super crowded and not enough recliners/sitting area.  Went to the pool at 0830 and it wasn’t busy yet. Hard to book on their restaurants. Our room was spacious with a great view of the Marina Bay Gardens. Nothing so special with the room, though.  It’s like a typical Vegas hotel room. I checked this experience off my bucket list. Will try staying at other hotels next time I visit.","3 years ago on

V C,5/5,"Things I didn't know:
Pool access is no longer restricted to one entry per day as it was until recently - you can now go whenever you want
They will email a day before asking you to pick a check in time slot but this is not essential.

Location:
Great location to explore Gardens by the Bay - you can see the light show from a garden view room but it is probably too far away to hear the music. Apart from the shopping mall and hotel restaurants, I don't there are other cheap eats or supermarket nearby. The metro station is next to the hotel though. Also much quicker to get to the airport from here compared to the downtown hotels - it's closer to the highway.

Check in:
There are queues to check in and it took us about 20 minutes. Make sure you ask everything you need to to avoid queuing again! They were relaxed about extending check out by an hour to 12pm. We had a basic garden view king bed room. They gave a free mooncake which was a nice touch.

Room:
Very clean and seemed modern (not sure if it has been refurbished recently). Large bathroom with good shower. Huge TV screen! Balcony was spacious with stunning views of Gardens by the Bay and the ships beyond.

Pool:
We missed sunset but went at about 7am. Few people around then so easy to have great photos just after sunrise. Possible to swim a few lengths too. There are 3 main pools and one of these allows children with supervision. There is also a very small children's pool with clear plastic walls. Definitely the highlight of our stay. The pool staff know this is why people stay at the hotel and they are very helpful and friendly. The pool is open from 6am to 11pm.

Highly recommend a stay here as part of a Singapore vacation. It is the iconic building of Singapore - combine it with Gardens by the Bay. 2 nights may be better - we didn't have time for ArtScience museum, the Spectra light show, or wandering around the mall.","3 years ago on

Aziz Khalid,2/5,"The check in was not as smooth as it usually is, I wasn’t offered water or a towel.

Bathroom: old and has an unpleasant sewage smell.

Room: needs renovation for the current price tag, room does not offer extra features that are worth it. They only offer complementary water and soda.
The cost per floor is absurd so the higher the floor the more expensive.
The key stopped on the third day and had to wait 10 minutes to have a replacement key.

Bed: is stiff and and on the short side by your feet also the cover sounds like it has plastic.

Locations: is good but not perfect since it seems like being on an a bridge or over water","a year ago on

Kate Driskell,4/5,"This isn't really a hotel, it's a captured resort experience. The rooms are enormous, fabulous and the housekeeping is absolutely top notch; we did not want for bottled water and juices over our 5 night stay.

The views are great if you get a high enough room and if you really want access to the pool then you must be booked into a high enough floor to be allowed. Access to the pool is strictly by one room key being presented per adult.

Where this place really falls down is that you absolutely must place a reservation if you want to eat. We were turned away at every single restaurant on the night we arrived and ended up having to order room service food. Inevitably wth a place this size, even despite the insulated trolley, it was cold by the time it got to us. For those of us who are more spontaneous, this is frustrating.","2 years ago on

It is not only beautiful, but waking up on the 50+ floors you feel like a king. I would recommend staying 2 to 3 nights here then move on to a beach place like sentosa or vice versa. The hotel amenities obviously is the access to the pool which is until 10pm. The gym is 24/7 and staff is there until 11pm. Water pressure was not the best but big enough shower to feel comfortable.","2 years ago on

The facilities are second to none. From the absolutely amazing laundry to the incredible breakfast and dinners, utterly stunning roof top pool to swim, rest, incredible views and lots of pics!!!!

MBS works like clockwork. It’s immaculately clean throughout, the amazingly stunning displays in the atrium and hall created in house, check in a dream and so informative to the incredible caring staff who come over and talk to you.

If you need a playground or a kids club for your kids they will tell you to visit the mall… incredible! However if you are in a party-all-night mood can be convenient as there are so many choices.

The event manager, Rachel Ho, was very attentive to all our needs and went above and beyond in making our wedding a pleasant and memorable event. Her experience helped us immensely during the planning as she guided us on timeline and decision-making. Everything was arranged promptly and perfectly for us, including special requests. She made our wedding planning a much less stressful process for us, which was a huge plus point which we appreciate deeply.

The dining banquet hall was big and spacious, and the decorations were beautiful as shown in pictures. Food was sumptuous and delightful.

Our package included a night stay in the wedding suite. The room was big and had an excellent view of Gardens by the Bay and the sea, a stunning view to wake up to in the morning. It was luxurious and much needed relaxation, especially after the wedding night.

Premium service team were ever-ready to assist us, anticipating our needs to provide us with an exceptional experience. Special shout out to Andre and Celeste who arranged for chocolates in our room and even gave us a thoughtful souvenir to let us remember our wedding and stay at MBS.

Overall, we had an unforgettable experience and will not hesitate to recommend MBS Singapore to anyone who plans to hold a wedding in the future.

Jennifer Lim,5/5,"Everything is great here. Reception staffs are very professional, efficient and friendly. They make sure you don't wait long. The room is very cosy, clean and well provided. Checking out is easy too. Shopping here is comfortable as there are lots of spaces to move around, lots of seats for one to rest when tired. The selection of restaurants is great and there are many different kind of shops to cater to different needs. Great to be there","5 years ago on

Bryan Wohlwend,4/5,"We decided to check off a bucket list item and stay at the Marina Bay Sands hotel specifically for the iconic pool.  And while I am glad we did, I likely wouldn’t stay there again honestly.  For the price, the rooms were really pretty average.  The view we had overlooking the Gardens by the Bay was great though as you could watch the Garden light show from your (tiny) balcony.  Bathroom was nice and large with good amenities.  Staff was overall friendly. The crowds definitely didn’t make it feel personal.  And frankly staying here felt almost like work rather than relaxing.  You had to remember to request check-in times and schedule pool times a day in advance (hard to do while traveling). Then each person has to have their own QR code—only available by SMS—for the pool, which was a problem because some in our party didn’t have cellular service to get the code. Luckily the pool staff accepted the room key and my confirmation email (likely helped we went early before it was crowded).  The pool was definitely impressive!!  It was also frustrating because they advertise over 90 restaurants but we didn’t know they all required reservations, even for lunch.  Most of these were in the mall (full of all the fancy stores and nothing in our price range!). We had a lot of trouble finding places to walk into to eat and that was just annoying.  It was also very crowded.  We did not visit the casino. Honestly the best way to describe the hotel is that you’ll feel like you are in a busy Vegas hotel like Caesar’s or the Bellagio.  It felt more like that than a 5 star hotel, especially considering it was likely the most expensive basic room I’ve ever stayed in.
Again it was fun to say we stayed there. We don’t regret it. But probably wouldn’t do it again. Just go into knowing to expect waits and crowds and that you are doing it to see one of the coolest pools ever.

I should note that one in my party completed a mid-stay survey from the hotel and got an almost instant follow up call. So they do seem to care about customer service.","3 years ago on

Mike Webberley,3/5,"One can’t help but be impressed by the size and appearance of this hotel and its location next to the very upmarket and expensive, casino and shopping mall. The rooftop bar and swimming pool are also definitely worth a look. However what it has in terms of grandeur we felt it lacks in terms of soul. The main concourse feels like an airport terminal except there is nowhere to sit and relax, have a coffee, and catch up with work or watch the world go by. The restaurants are OK but not great and the mall is very expensive and exclusive. We did like the lounge bar though and the gardens are great. If you really want to see Singapore I would suggest staying somewhere nearer to China town or Little India.","2 years ago on

Glenn Broadhurst,1/5,"Upon check-in, we waited as other have noted; Nothing is efficient.

We were then asked to pay, Room + a holding deposit, which we obliged.

I've never been asked to pay a holding deposit before, particularly when paying $1200 a night.

After making payment we were told there was no room available for us, and we were asked if we'd prefer a king bed or two single beds (for a family of four).

I had several email exchanges with staff prior to arrival and my wife also called on the phone to ensure the hotel was able to accommodate a family of four in one room. (Their website for some reason only allows Brookings for 3 people per room).

Being told by check-in staff that we had no room, after an 8 hour flight was exacerbating... If they'd told us before making payment we'd have simply walked out.

It was quite a horrible ruse.
It is entirely unfair and unreasonable.

Somehow after stating it was a ridiculous idea that four of us would share a bed, a room materialised.

The room was fine (just a standard room), however had two issues.

1) It is NOT a garden Room view which we booked and paid.

2) There are no linens for my second child. They missed out on even a towel.

To avoid frustration we decided to explore the hotel, where we looked for the observation deck.

The CE LA VE staff were simply rude.

Told us they were fully booked before we even had a chance to ask what CE LA VE was... I'm still not sure, I think it's a restaurant which we're not welcome to attend.

I travel around the world for work, and this is surely the most over-hyped hotel I have ever stayed.

Beds are uncomfortable, service is slow.

The pool view is great, but hardly anything to dribble over for your Instagram.

Oh at 9:30pm we had staff try and deliver a birthday cake... Which would have been nice, but it wasn't anyone's birthday.

Someone did try and call to ""apologies"" but their solution was to give us free breakfast... Which I had to inform them we'd already paid for with our room.

The Premier Room in Tower 1 was spacious and featured small improvements from the last time I was here, including Nespresso machine with daily replenishments of coffee capsules, free minibar, and an upgraded Smart TV. The rooms did feel a bit dated given this is a few years old, but the hotel rooms are being progressively refurbished (New rooms in Tower 2 are already opened for booking at time of writing). The hotel is always busy and the check-in experience can be rather chaotic and rushed. But otherwise an unforgettable experience at a Singapore landmark.","2 years ago on

The rooms did feel a bit dated given this is a few years old, but the hotel rooms are being progressively refurbished (New rooms in Tower 2 are already opened for booking at time of writing). The hotel is always busy and the check-in experience can be rather chaotic and rushed. But otherwise an unforgettable experience at a Singapore landmark."

Jia Jia Phua,4/5,"It was my first time at MBS! We had to wait 2 hours + just to check in 😞 honestly disappointing. Nonetheless we were given a decent floor with a city view (garden view faces Gardens by the Bay). Our room was extremely huge with 2 TVs and could easily fit another queen bed. No bath tub! The amenities had to be pre-booked but the system was easy to use. The pool was as picturesque as it seems and the sauna/steambath/hot pool was great! I was the only one there, and it came with fresh towels and shower facilities.

There's plenty of food nearby, even a super market! Room service was however a little slow, we had finished our cup noodles by the time utensils arrived.","3 years ago on

The annoying downside:
- quill/bedcover/blanket so heavy and made so much crisp noise like theres plastic inside. Get up slowly if you dont want to wake the others up.
- staff being rather unfriendly although professional. The guards kept asking me to show my room card, almost everytime im about to enter the lift, as if i was just a young kid who cant afford MBS and randomly entered the premises. But in the other hand, they never asked any chinese oldman or western guy in front of or behind me🖕 Fyi i am 30yo+ with a pregnant wife.

Zell Low,5/5,"Had a one night stay at MBS for my birthday celebration last week with my wife. The stay was amazing! From the time we check-in, the front desk check in process was seamless and attentive. They aware that it’s my birthday and arrange a birthday cake send to my room.

The highlight of the trip definitely is the infinity pool. We manage to book a swimming pool slots by their online systems and the pool capacity is limited due to the covid SMM. This creates a even more magical moment to me as all of us get to have a beautiful slots in pool to relax and take lots of lovely photos.

Prior entering the pool, one of my biggest concern will be the water quality in the swimming pool as I had sensitive skin where I avoid public pool due to the cleanness and chlorine. To my surprise, I didn’t had any skin irritation after the swim! I’m truly amazed by the water quality of the swimming quality and the team that maintain the pool definitely deserve a praise!

Overall we had a very pleasant stay especially the experience in the infinity pool. Will definitely go back for the stay again!","3 years ago on

Mani C,3/5,Incredibly overpriced and probably worst service of any 5 star hotel in Singapore.  It's like a fish market or a zoo. Even if you attend a conference at MBS there are so many nice hotels within 5 minutes drive from MBS.  Do yourself a favor if you want to stay in a luxury hotel and expand 1-2km away from MBS.  You will be much happier.,"2 years ago on

Harry Sufehmi,1/5,"Checking in at 23:00 / 11:00 pm, and had to pay deposit. The problem is - it can NOT accept debit card from the most popular bank in Indonesia, BCA. Also it failed to accept payment from my Citibank Visa card.

So I had to look around for ATM, at 11 pm, get some cash from it, with NO PROBLEM using that debit card that was rejected by the hotel, and head back again.

And of course the check-out process became slower, because I had to get back my deposit as cash again.

And during the whole stay in S'pore I was, ALWAYS, able to use that debit card with no problem - except in a small diner, where the staffs does not even  speak English & only accept NEST or cash; but that's of course  understandable. A five star hotel? Unbelievable.

====

The hotel staffs however are amazing and very helpful. It's clear from their body language that they're genuinely care about you.

Once I had to ask for help with the TV, I tried to connect it to my laptop via HDMI cable, but no joy. The tech guy arrived shortly, and very apologetic.
He listened to my explanation, and fully accept that the issue is on their side - usually, people will try to blame my laptop (I use Linux, not Windows)

He worked really fast, but clearly it stumped him at first. He apologized so much I almost laughed - I had to say to him to take his time, I'm in no rush at all; yet he still tried his hardest. It was amazing.

Pretty soon he figured out the root cause, and my laptop finally able to connect to the TV. I thanked him, and he apologized again in return, while it was not even his fault.

The hotel should count itself very lucky to have such diligent staffs like him.

I forgot to ask for his name, anyway I stayed in room 520, from 11 to 13 Dec 2022.","2 years ago on

Dhara Shantilal Jain,4/5,"So before leaving Singapore, Marina Bay Sands was in my bucjet list and hence we had to go there for a staycation, otherwise its infinity pool could have haunted me forever 😛

We had two kids with us and we were in the infinity pool for most of the time ( upto 6-7hrs / day) ... the view from the pool is breathtaking but the breeze at this high rise is just freezing 😬😬😬 so we ordered some yummy hot vegetarian snack but to our dismay there wasnt much for vegetarians.. so we got fries, juices and hot coffee.

Apart from the infinity there isnt much for kids in the hotel.. but yes if you go downstairs to explore you will find great options like science exhibit, shopping malls, boat ride, laser show in the evenings..

For food I would recommend getting down the hotel and explore other options as there are many.","3 years ago on

Robert Schremmer,3/5,"This is a hard review to write. Marina Bay Sands was, by far, the most expensive hotel I’ve ever stayed, and is certainly an icon in Singapore. Since that was true, my expectations were particularly high. And Marina Bay just didn’t meet them.

Doing anything there is more challenging than most hotels. You have to reserve a time to check in. That’s actually more of a problem than it seems since most people fly in on international flights and have to clear customs and immigration, which can be unpredictable. Plus, reservation times become limited the closer to your stay. We arrived about an hour and a half earlier than our reservation. It was not immediately clear what to do when we arrived. Just about 30 seconds before we were approached by a helpful staff member, we noticed a small sign with a lot of writing and a QR code that signs you into the check in queue. We scanned the code, and after about a 10-minute wait, it was our turn to approach the desk and start the check in process. Evidently there are times of the day when Registration is extremely crowded, so the hotel has instituted these extra steps. Thankfully, it wasn’t that crowded when we arrived, but the whole process is still quite cumbersome.

You must also use a QR code to register if you want to use the famous rooftop pool. No access without first registering. By the way, after registering for a check in time and pool access, the hotel sends an SMS with confirmations. Of course, you must have an international phone plan that allows you to receive SMS messages.

The hotel room itself was nice enough. Spacious. Nothing particularly stands out as being a super expensive room, except we did have a fantastic view of the Marina Bay Gardens. Other than the view, it felt like any other convention hotel room I’ve ever stayed in.

The rooftop pool is as spectacular as all the pictures depict.

All in all, the hotel has a very Las Vegas feel to it - massive, crowded, casino and hyper-expensive shopping mall, nightly water and light shows. It was ok for one visit, but I wouldn’t pay that much to stay there again.","3 years ago on

Jane Lim,5/5,"We had to reserve our check in timing a day prior to our stay. We were allowed to check in early, which was good for us, since I requested for it after making reservations. The check in personnel - Shirley was able to explain the details clearly to us, and wished us happy anniversary since she knew we were celebrating our anniversary. She also check to ensure we made reservations for the infinity pool.
The staff at MBS are very friendly. They greet their guests and is usually with smiles.
The room was very spacious and ours was facing the sea. There is also complimentary snacks and drinks. They have us a small chocolate cake for our celebration.

Parking and walking to the hotel is difficult. There is no direct connection from carpark to the hotel. The walk from carpark to the hotel lobby is very far. The signage is very confusing.
We parked in central, and it took us a round about walk to hotel lobby 1, walk back to tower 3 for check in whereas I could have directly walked from central area to tower 3 check in!

The breakfast at Spago was good. Although we were limited to the mains, but it was really more than enough to fill us. The infinity pool is truly amazing with it’s bay view. It’s best to book a day and night trip, so you get to have different views.

Overall, we enjoyed our stay very much and the service they provide.","3 years ago on

The room was on the 46 floor with views on both sides that is the city and gardens by the bay. Amazing and breathtaking views; the room upkeep was disappointing, it felt old and technologically outdated. In room dining was below average however the breakfast at the lobby was excellent.  Overall 3 stars only for the views but felt this hotel to be overpriced in respect to the room and the facilities you receive.","4 years ago on

June Wade,3/5,"Booked reservations Oct 12-16 2022 .

On arrival, check in was less than 10 minutes (poor lobby seating noted). We were greeted by Sara(FOSARASVSI), front desk clerk who was very polite, professional and a true gem during our check-in process. We purchased the REIMAGINE Package at the time of booking (3nights) and did not realize this was going to be the biggest headache.
Sara explained that we must visit an agent within the hotel to redeem our REIMAGINE package/card/etc. , then proceed to any Silver Kiosk to print vouchers for daily redemption (breakfast, lunch, etc.)

After 4 hours of travel, I was not pleased to hear we had to go on a scavenger hunt in this massive hotel/ casino for an expensive package we purchased.

My husband and I walked down to the Casio( Near Metro/711) to find the nearest agent, then we were questioned if we had a MBS rewards card. The agent reluctantly proceeded to print a card and then instruct us to find a silver kiosk for vouchers. We spent approx. 1 hour with this process.

We returned to the desk to speak with a manager about the inefficient, cumbersome process  of redeeming the package purchased. She walked us to the nearest un user friendly kiosk to help us print vouchers ( We desired early am breakfast and did not want to run around the hotel early morning to redeem).

In addition, the room electronics were nice but too much. Motion light sensors continuously came on during the night while moving in bed. The power to the electric toilet went out (2nd day) and there was no manual flush. I had to take 30 flights down to the lobby restroom , so I did not embarrass anyone while maintenance worked on the toilet electronics.
In addition, we had reservations at one of the restaurants on 57th floor and if you get off on the wrong side of the elevators be prepared to deal with the pool police not allowing you to walk across without room key in hand. The staff was not useful in directing us to the restaurant location.

The last day on check out ,we were bringing our luggage to the lobby and was a approached by Mr. Jeevan Rao, Manager, Service Management., he was the true angel that redeemed a frustrating stay for us. I explained our disappointing experience while we were checking luggage for hold and he immediately whisk us to the VIP lounge. Mr. Rao was so kind, polite and exemplified the upmost professionalism in customer service.
We were gifted lunch in the VIP section of Rise Restaurant, where we met Mr. Daniel Whitelaw , General Manager Rise Restaurant such an amazing personality and a truly kind person. He made sure we were comfortable, our needs were met during our lunch. We were truly  grateful to have met such an exceptional team that cared about our experience.

We also had local shaved ice cream and bubble tea. A great break spot when you don’t want to face the heat outdoors.","6 years ago on

Dulji_Wak,5/5,"It was one of the most fantastic experiences I've had when it came to staycations!! Stayed in this hotel to celebrate our Anniversary and felt like a dream come true!! ! The hotel surprised us with a lovely anniversary cake which was a pleasant surprise!The infinity pool is beyond amazing and the rooms were spotlessly clean! The view from our room was quite worth the money!! Check in was  slow due to very long queue but the staff was friendly and helpful! Due to covid situ they only allow one hour slots in the pool which you will need to book before you go to the hotel.. The jacuzzi was less crowded in the morning.. The ambience in the restaurants are lovely but the food is quite pricy..The hotel rooms were very cosy and the bed was comfortable.. You can never get bored during a staycation at this hotel as there is such alot to do and roam around in places like the shoppes, and the hotel lobby area, infinity pool area!  An easy way to reach the hotel is through the Bayfront MRT incase you take public transport.. Highly recommend this hotel and I encourage everyone to book a stay here.. You will not regret!","Edited 3 years ago on

Evan Tan,5/5,"We keep coming back to MBS for the various activities we love doing here like the Canvas Light, the Sampan Ride, and plenty of other things to do right outside like the ArtScience Museum.

The myriad of things to explore and do is the reason it's perfect for everyone. There's always gonna be something for everyone to do. For the gamblers, the casino is just around the corner. For the foodies, there is a plethora of amazing food options. And for the families with children, there are loads of activities for children to enjoy.","2 years ago on

Carlissa Talbott,2/5,"You would think for a 5 star hotel, customer service would be impeccable, but I am saddened to report otherwise. After a long vacation in Indonesia, I was excited to kick my feet up and relax in this gorgeous hotel. Check in went smoothly, and I was greeted by a luxurious room and bathroom. For almost $1,000 USD a night, all I wanted was some peace and quiet. This was not the case. Hotel staff barged into my room not once, but TWICE, both times I was undressed and yelling at the top of my lungs to please wait as I collected myself. The first was partially my fault as I had slept through the alarm to go downstairs and extend my stay, however after YELLING repeatedly to wait, they still came in. The second time, the front desk made no attempt to communicate with housekeeping that I had indeed extended it. Come to find out, the front desk thought I wanted to change my key card (?) even though I handed over my passport and credit card and said I am paying for the room extension. As a female traveling alone, with past trauma with men, this was NOT the experience I wanted. I am deeply upset. I spoke to the manager, Atlan, who offered me a complimentary breakfast and taxi to apologize for the event, and we later settled for $150 Singapore dollars ($109 USD) in credit towards the room fare. It is a bit disappointing to know that the traumatic event and violation was only worth that much in his eyes. My room service server, Balan, was very kind and helpful, along with the bell hops I had the pleasure of meeting. Do not get me wrong, the hotel is exquisite, however, I will not be coming back again.","2 years ago on

Huy Pham,5/5,"So…if your reading this your probably trying to find a reason (or a bad review) for “not” spending the money and staying here. Well I’ll tell you this, you won’t. In fact, that’s probably the only reason why you wouldn’t wanna stay here.

Was it expensive? No, it was outrageously expensive. Lol. But I have to say it was worth the stay though. You sure get what you pay for and this place is a testament to that saying.

From the moment we arrived, my wife and I were greeted like first class. We arrived in a taxi and there were two hotel greeters that opened our doors. They took our bags and told us that it’ll be waiting for us in the room.

Everyone (hotel workers) was super nice and respectful. Your definitely treated like kings and queens here. This place is more of like a resort. There’s soo much to do and see. From casinos, to shopping, the gardens by the bay, night clubs, and the fine dining. Did I also mention the infinity pool? Yes, we to paid to stay here for the infinity pool like most people do.

Overall, if your going to travel to Singapore and wanna get the full “Singapore” experience then I encourage that you do stay at least one or two nights at the Marina Bag Sands. You don’t come here often and maybe once in a lifetime, so I do recommend staying here. Besides the wonderful food Singapore has to offer, this was the nightlight of our vacation.

Shoutout to the front desk person who helped us checked in, Caine! Super friendly and knowledgeable. He gave us a bunch of advice, tips, and things to do during our stay. He even was able to find us a room for early check in. Thanks Caine!","3 years ago on

Fiqah Jhry,5/5,"Booked for 3D2N for my partner’s birthday. Really loved the check in and pool reservation booking system which was easy and seamless! As we were waiting at the lobby for our Queue number to be called, a FO staff asked for our Queue number and informed us there were 2 more guests ahead of us.

Our check in staff was Alice. Her service was excellent! As she processed our booking, she noticed the date and it was my partner’s birthday which I didn’t mention upon reservation. Alice wished him Happy Birthday and upgraded us from Premier Garden view to Premier Harbour view and explained it’s on the higher floor. She also extended our check out time from 11am to 1pm which we did not have to ask. She explained the hotel’s facilities really well and also informed us a complimentary birthday cake will be sent to our room. We checked in at 2.35pm.

Our room was on 44th floor, it was big, clean and has a really breathtaking view. We went out for dinner and when we came back, there was a birthday cake on the table. Huang Xiu was the Housekeeping staff in charge for our room. On day 2, he rang our bell at about 3-4pm and spoke in mandarin which I had difficulty understanding. He pointed at the “Make Up Room” button which I told him he doesn’t need to make up the room. We went out for dinner, came back and the room was made up. Huang Xiu had replenished the towels, amenities & bar items. What I appreciate was, he placed the new bath mat at the exact spot I placed the used one.

The infinity pool was obviously beyond amazing. Booking for the time slots was easy and so was cancelling a slot which we did due to heavy rain. The staff at the infinity pool were all so friendly. My partner asked the Lifeguard which way is the washroom. The lifeguard, got down from his seat just to tell him the way.

I would also like to add that we went to Ce La Vi and each staff from the first floor, the counter and the waitress & waitresses that served our drinks were great! Also, Muhammad Fitri had been really helpful during our stay and also called the room to wish my partner a Happy Birthday.

Overall, MBS was a fantastic experience for us and for my partner’s birthday and each of the staff we met along way even if it was a small gesture, can be felt with warmth and sincerity.","3 years ago on

Mark P,1/5,"I was very disappointed with my stay at MBS as I was awoken multiple times through the night by a guest having a party in the room next door to me. I had to engage with the hotel reception and despite them calling security to the room they were unable to stop the issue for 3 hours. This ruined my stay and the only compensation I was offered was an upgrade next time I stay. I feel that a more appropriate gesture would have been to refund a quarter of the cost of my stay. I engaged with the customer service team but they have not responded to my requests for appropriate compensation. Given the cost of staying at MBS I have high expectations regarding customer service and based on my experience these were not met.

I would not recommend staying at MBS.","3 years ago on

Jan P,4/5,"Amazing view and the pool is indeed great if you find the right slot (early morning, you can only
book 1 slot per day). All staff is kind and friendly, a great achievement during the pandemic. That’s what you really pay for - the rest is more 4-stars and therefore a bit pricey. Especially it seems everything is intentionally overpriced to encourage discounts via membership and points, eg Spa starts > 300$. Breakfast is best at Spago but eg doesn’t have Barista coffee. Rooms don’t have fresh fruit every day or turndown service, minor things.","4 years ago on

Reported this to the concierge with photos evidence. Was advised to email them the photos for investigation purpose but they totally went silent about this with no acknowledgement or reply. Tried to follow up twice but still have not received any response from them after almost a month.

Totally unexpected from a ""world class"" hotel with zero privacy. Stay at your own risk and ensure that you do not keep any valuables inside the room.","2 years ago on

The MBS has multiple things to explore such as sky view point (but tickets upfront,  and visit during evening), 3 hotel towers (try to book hotel with city view, and do try infinity pool, it’s worth), shopping around for all branded products, Casino(carry your EP/Dp/passport with visitpass email) lack of eateries, sitting area, restroom.

T K,4/5,"This iconic hotel is very near to airport, approx 15 mins by Taxi, so great location to explore city.  Lots of communal areas with shops and a Casino, plus a SkyPark (aka SkyDeck), but we found these and the lobby areas nearly always crowded, with hardly anywhere to sit, so if you are looking for a 5 star hotel with relaxing, quite public areas this one is not recommended. Had to queue for check-in and no welcome drink but room was comfortable (nothing special, more like 4 Star) and spacious, but on sixth floor, opposite the highway, so if you book this floor be prepared for some background road noise. AC a little noisy, but kept room cool. House-keeping excellent and kept room spotless. Room Key-cards can be temperamental so keep away from your mobile phone in pocket or handbag, unless you enjoy 20 min excursions to lobby with inevitable queues to recharge. Huge infinity pools (x3) with amazing views of city below and beyond, best one on 57th floor. Pools are open from 6am till 11pm, however be aware that they are not heated and can get very crowded during peak times when “selfie” mania takes over. Also not that it can take a few lift changes to get to them depending on where your room is. The Skypark is great fun, providing a great panoramic view of the city, especially at night. Highly recommend the morning Yoga class just for the fantastic vista. Note that SkyPark is open to public too, not just Hotel guests. If you don’t mind bustling crowds, location, city views and infinity pools are indeed 5 Star, else for service, room and value we’d rate more like 4 Star.","5 years ago on

Fun Kwok,4/5,"This is a high end retail mall offering a mind blowing shopping experience to shoppers. Shoppers can choose anything from a simple supermarket to high end branded products in this mall.
There is pretty much everything and anything here. There are a lot of high end restaurants here too and they have Michelin starred restaurants in this mall too.
Outside of the mall, there is also a light show at stipulated timings and this attracts a huge crowd of tourists.
Families can also opt to bring their children to the nearby ArtScience museum for the Future World exhibition. There is also a schedule of musicals/performances in the ever popular MasterCard theatre.
One thing to note of this mall, as there is a huge crowd of shopper flow, the taxi stand may sometimes have a long wait. In addition the toilets may not be of clean standards as it is not possible for the cleaning attendants to keep up their cleaning as the place has too many patrons. Toilet paper may be lacking too due to the same reason.","7 years ago on

Marine DEBATTE,1/5,"I spend my life on hotels and wanted to do MBS once before leaving Singapore.  A must do they say...
I couldn't be more disappointed by the service and how they handle the situation. They constantly check on you to stay away from people but... have nothing in place to speed up the check in process (other hotels in town will have automated kiosks, roaming staff or online check in to speed it up).
We queued literally for 1 hour to check in. Process was soooo tedious... unbelievable for a property of this size. Staff are obviously not trained.
This was for our honeymoon as a gift from friends and despite their request early in advance, nothing was done. Not a card, not the slightest attention. Such a disappointment for a hotel of that so called 5 star level.
Not only this is overrated but they haven't figured out how to handle the situation at all. For a place of that size and all the PR they do... needless to say that we were expecting something at least decent.
Hours of wait to get to the pool, with not even control on it so we are not even sure we will be allowed up at any point of our stay. Price is not down but stay hours are reduced (check in 3 pm and out by 11 am...).
Rooms are dated but decent.
View is spectacular from either side, that's the only star I can give...
Stay away everyone... other places will give you a way better value.","5 years ago on

Being a massive space, one can easily loses the orientation if you are here searching for a specific commercial outlet because the unit numbers are very inconspicuous while the signboards are practically unhelpful to those who are new to the place.","Edited 6 years ago on

A S,4/5,"We stayed here for 2 nights in early November 2020 to celebrate a family member's birthday.

As safe distancing measures were still in effect, there were procedures which you need to note:
a) you need to book your slot to enter roof top pool. To avoid disappointment, it is advisable to book ahead of your stay. I emailed the hotel to obtain the booking details and booked weeks before check in. The view is fantastic so don't miss it.
b) you also need to book a slot to exercise @ the gym via sms. The difference between booking the pool and the gym is that there are pre-defined slots to go to the pool while it is go when it is your turn for the gym.The view @ the gym is fantastic too so don't miss it.
c) entry to and out to the lifts to go back to your room is screened
d) it is good to book dining venues too, particularly popular restaurants like Ce La Vi.

As for the room, we found the offerings dated, particularly the TV entertainment. Perhaps they could offer Netfix programme. The room is otherwise spacious and comfortable. Our rooms face Gardens by the bay and this side is where you can veiw sunrise. A complimentary birthday was sent to our room too on request.","4 years ago on

b) you also need to book a slot to exercise @ the gym via sms. The difference between booking the pool and the gym is that there are pre-defined slots to go to the pool while it is go when it is your turn for the gym.The view @ the gym is fantastic too so don't miss it.
c) entry to and out to the lifts to go back to your room is screened
d) it is good to book dining venues too, particularly popular restaurants like Ce La Vi.

As for the room, we found the offerings dated, particularly the TV entertainment. Perhaps they could offer Netfix programme. The room is otherwise spacious and comfortable. Our rooms face Gardens by the bay and this side is where you can veiw sunrise. A complimentary birthday was sent to our room too on request."

Ferdiantono Lim,1/5,"For such a luxurious premise, I can hardly feel the class these days. My review is based onm experience here several times in different years including when I lived in Singapore be it for shopping, dining or entertainment. Tried their michelin star restaurants, not up to my expected standard in terms of flavor. Watched shows in their halls, it was okay and probably the only good memory I had of this place. Their food court sucks so much. More of a basic tourist place rather than upscale shopping destination how it was meant to be.","6 years ago on

John Varkey,5/5,"Unbelievable service for our short stay at MBS. Our flight to Singapore arrived at 6am.  We were hoping for a early checkin. Faith at the Tower 1 check in desk provided outstanding service. Although they did not have a room ready for us, Faith set us with temp key cards so we could freshen up in the fitness center and use the pool. That was very welcome after our red eye flight in. We were told we would get a call when our room was ready so we chilled at the pool and hot tub taking advantage of the awesome views. Never received a call so we came back at normal check in time, 3pm to get our room. The front desk said the room had been available since this morning which was a bit disappointing. Anyways, our luggage was already delivered to the room.  When I checked my email, MBS sent a mid stay survey. Thinking nothing of it, I filled out the survey and mentioned I was disappointed in not getting a call and this is where their service shined. Within a few minutes of submitting the survey, I got a call Nicole in Service Management. This has never happened. She wanted to know more so they could improve and how she could make it up to us. I declined her offer and told her I just wanted to provide constructive feedback. She insisted on making our stay memorable and indeed she did. She sent us a bottle of champagne, provided us with a 1pm late check out and arranged a car for us to go to the airport. I even mentioned I was planning on pushing back our dinner reservation at Rise and she took care of that for us. Nicole did help us realize that although I never got a call, I was sent an email about the room being ready that went to my junk. Good thing she didn’t hold it against me. Pro tip: Don’t forget to check your junk mail.Thank you to Nicole, Faith, and the entire staff at MBS. Your dedication to service makes you stand out. You will be at the top of my list anytime I’m in Singapore.","2 years ago on

The outdoor promenade has an amazing view of the Singapore skyline, without of course that of the iconic Marina Bay Sands itself which is right above you.

Flo G,5/5,"Absolute Vegas vibes gigantic shopping mall with all the luxury brands under one roof and countless eateries for different budget.

A place one could come back over and over whether to shop or just to soak in the atmosphere.

Visit one of the most iconic maison of Louis Vuitton on water, or the only Apple store in the world with an escalator.

You could also catch one of the many events happening all the time or take a walk outside.

Crowds are crazy from Fridays to weekends, a great sign of booming economy.

Dining tips : either make bookings way in advance for higher end dining or choose one which doesn’t take reservations and join the queues.

Ippudo is a great option next to the more expensive foodcourt in Sg.

For a great view of the rain occulus action, do Beanstro for a drink at appropriate times namely 3:30pm 8pm & 9:30pm.","2 years ago on

allson chng,4/5,"Great experience overall! Room is immaculate, housekeeping is speedy, food is great (Please try the breakfast potateos at SPAGO!) but 2 negatives.

Parking situation at MBS was horrible (15/12,). It was frustrating and I was late for check in at 2.30pm by about 30 mins. I approached a short hair Filipino service staff at the hotel for help with check in but was told the next check in time will be at 5pm and I will be the last in line for that time slot and she was ""sorry"" she can't do anything about it! That is an additional 2 hours wait with my luggage and I have Gardens by the bay booking at 4.30pm! I had hope to freshen up before I visit GBTB! She advised us to leave our luggage and ""have some coffee"" for 2 hours. I know I am late for check in with very good reason but to make me wait for a further 2 hours and give some ridiculous advise of coffee for 2 hours just to check in? I am in the service line for 20 years and I did not sense any hallmarks of quality service from her, she has failed to understand my problem from my POV and stuck to the rules of check in timing to the letter. No empathy at all This is just a staff drawing salary and giving lip service to MBS guest. Why bother to be in ""customer service"" industry when a robot running on smart contract can do the same exact job? Why station a human at the check in area if you can't solve a guest problem with a human approach?

I did not make a big fuss and cooled off for 5 mins at the side before I approached another tall bald Indian service staff. I explained myself like I did to the Filipino staff and he helped me to a physical queue for check in. He understood my pain and took immediate action that cost nothing to MBS to solve my problem. The room was already ready and it ONLY took 5 mins for the counter staff to check us in. This fact pisses me off even further with the short hair Filipino staff. It is comforting and good to know that there are some staff at MBS that understood customer service and they will always have my thanks and appreciation. But not to those that just pay lip service to ""quality service"".

Second would be the Infinity pool booking. I understand it is peak period with the holidays but the booking system is flawed. I stayed there for 3D2N and failed to book a 2nd slot for the 2nd day at check in. I refreshed the booking at every chance I get but did not see any slots opening up. My concern is, there isn't any penalty with no show and that is fine (its okay there shouldnt be a penalty for no show) but the empty slots that are no show could be better used for walk ins. If I walk in and get rejected because it is full, its fine but if the pool is not full and I get rejected as a walk in for my entitled booking, that isn't right.","3 years ago on

One week before our stay I could booked the pool online as all slots are unavailable. On thé day when I checked in, I told the manager I was upset that I couldn’t visit the pool. Jessica was very helpful. She asked to give her some time and see what she could do. She managed to get a time slot for 3 persons in the pool. I was very thankful to her. Really appreciate her help. We got a free upgrade to deluxe king room facing the garden on the 49th floor. The room is big with an awesome balcony view. When I booked the hotel, i wrote in comment that it was my wedding anniversary. We got complimentary lovely chocolate cake and a coffee cup made of chocolate. So wonderful. There were so much things to do. We need to book a slot for the gym, a slot sauna/hot tub for female and free access to the sky park observation deck. We also had a good dinner at Spargo. Origin + Bloom has fantastic sandwiches n breakfast options where hotel guests got 20% discount. I recommend Early Riser bun. Overall, it’s a marvellous stay here.","4 years ago on

On December 22nd, 2022, I contacted Marina Bay Sands hoping to plan surprise proposal to my girlfriend on the Sky Observatory deck. No other piece of modern architecture is more iconic than MBS in Southeast Asia and I had my eyes set.

In just the few days before the Christmas holiday, Nicole was offered to connect with my 3rd party photographer and help coordinate the proposal as if I asked my best friend one favor in my lifetime. She is an amazing human and I can tell why MBS is lucky to have her be the face of their iconic brand.

Nicole granted permission for my photographer to be at the Sky Observatory Deck for the special moment when I popped the question. She even kept in communication with my photographer on a 2 hour photoshoot to surprise us with a generous gift with chilled champagne and truffle chocolates in our room when we returned.

The property itself is fantastic - from the intimate infinity pools, to the world-class architecture in the casino, to the immense amount of beautiful shops in the mall. Oh, and we cannot forget the delicious food at the food courts.

The experience at the property was far superior than the hundreds (yes hundreds) of times that I've visited in Las Vegas. But, it was truly the delicately care that Nicole selflessly provided that truly meant more than anything.","2 years ago on

Edmund Tham,3/5,"Was there to attend a Golden Jubilee Function organised by FFL, ROM and ROMM.

Poorly organised function requiring old age pple to stand and queue to receive their certificates with quite a number of them having walking difficulties..

Food provided was mass production, lousy quality and service provided was quite unacceptable...spoons with chipped edges were used, outer layer of asparagus was not removed making it hard to chew, fried rice was the most disappointing as its soggy...

Other than the appearance of MBS which looks gd, no other good points to bring up...","a year ago on

If you want to go the lounge they will say oh you are not eligible To enter unless you are in the premium room..again they will tell you if you want to go to the lounge we can upgrade you the premium to go to the lounge…

To entry to the Swimming pool You need to do advance booking and they make it complicated…

During this pandemic period, moving outdoors and indoors are quite cumbersome.  There are entry/exit points at both end of the Shoppes and alot of other entry and exit points are closed offs.

But despite this, this is still very popular and is filled the footfalls at peak hours.

Hopefully, these temporary restrictions will be lifted soon and the place can return to previous normal.","4 years ago on

Now this date, you have to show your room card, photo ID and room # your name to go to your room.
Even you go out, they want to know. What is it for? They didn’t explain. Why doing this now and not last few months? I’m not coming back. At least explain the new policy to us, and we can decide if we want to come to MBS.","Edited 4 years ago on

Helen Chen,2/5,"This feedback is solely on the Casino that I happened to bring my parents to. Service experience were kind of disappointing not because of the staff but because of the rigid rule that could not make exceptions for:

1) Member who bring all ID cards(including passport & Casino VIP card if I remember correctly) except for a Long term social visit pass which they insisted must be sighted before allowing my father who was then seriously ill to ONLY make a brief visit to motivate himself a bit. Really upset with the STRICTLY NO EXCEPTION rule even after I explained to them the purpose of visit. Though it had happened a number of years back, this experience unfortunately left a very deep but negative impression in my mind.

2) The casino could not offer much help to a non-gambling person (that's me) who needed help to look for her mother whose whereabout in the casino became a question mark. I could do nothing but to wait outside the exit area. This occurred last month (29th April 2023)","2 years ago on

Our commendations to Reshmi at the counter, Dan at the pool and all the staff who served us the day we were there! They really did observe covid restrictions very strictly and made sure we were all safe!

Got upgraded to a room on the 50th floor as our room wasnt ready and got the best view!

We got a few perks the day we were there - one complimentary exhibition at the Arts Science Museum (plastics exhibition only) and we also got to go up to the skypark for free (just show your hotel card)

Be sure to make full use of these perks (and more!)when youre staying there!

Some cons were that the room we were in did not have a bath tub and there was no bidet in the toilet. But if one was really particular about that, you can request for a room with these items.

But the view totally made up for it!

Would definitely go again if there were another deal! 10/10 experience :)","4 years ago on

Richelle Pante,5/5,"We went to Marina Bay Sands to checkout the attractions (Skypark, ArtScience Museum, Sampan Ride) and to watch the Spectra Light Show. On the day we went, there was a lightning warning so SkyPark was closed until they are given a go signal. They will honor your ticket until 5pm or you can ask for refund. Popular times for SkyPark is 6-8pm so that's probably the reason why our 3pm ticket can only be honored until 5pm.

Spacious and comfortable to visit, though most of the shops here are high end and branded shops catering mostly to more well-to-do tourists. There's a great view of the marina bay area outside and most of Singapore's central attractions are nearby.

There is also an Art Science Museum just be the Helix Bridge. Do also stay tune at night where there's a light show outside. You can also take a boat ride too in the shopping area for a fee.

Quite enjoy the ambiance of the place even though most of the shops are well outside of my spending range.","7 years ago on

MBS is the most iconic hotel here and only tourist come here to stay. The main purpose here is to swim in the famous infinity pool.
Amazing views, and it isn’t that crowded like what people say.
There is a total of 3 large pool combined together with a lot of beach seats so do not worry about not finding a spot.
At the top, besides the infinity pool there is also 2 bars. Spago (more for food) and Ce La Vi which is a popular bar for people looking for drinks.","2 years ago on

The front counter service was responsive to our requests and all their towels are well sanitized.

Their amenities are great too, should definitely try all of them (Infinity pool, banyan tree fitness gym with all new & clean equipment, hot sauna, observatory deck). It was a memorable experience that I decided to book a night for my parents anniversary too!","4 years ago on

The hotel boasts stunning views of the city skyline, including the iconic Marina Bay Sands infinity pool on the 57th floor, which is one of the most famous rooftop swimming pools in the world. I enjoyed a variety of dining options, from casual eateries to fine dining restaurants, as well as a shopping mall with designer boutiques and a casino. The hotel also has a full-service spa and fitness center, and I took advantage of the nearby attractions such as Gardens by the Bay and the ArtScience Museum.

Travel 101,4/5,Location and service was perfect however room comfort could be greatly improved. In hotels of this category you would expect much better quality of bed.

To whomever is responsible for selection of bed in this property may I suggest staying at local Westin and experience their signature bed. The difference in comfort is shocking.,"3 years ago on

Christer Ø,1/5,"Took our money then asked everyone to leave because of incoming thunderstorm. Security perspective aside, they cashed in on visitors to the very last minute, which meant some would only have 10 minutes on the deck. For those that insisted, ticket validity was extended for 2 weeks, but as we were just visiting for 3 days, it was a empty gesture.

I asked if it could be extended for 6 months, which was of course denied. It may come across as a silly request, but hey, you gotta try and there’d actually be a chance we’d come back in that timeframe (and my 4 year old son loved the view).

We got the high floor and the view is FANTASTIC! Bay view you get to see musical fountain in the evening, and beautiful city night view. Sea view makes you feel like you're staying by the seaside.
The room is HUGE for singapore size, as big as the RWSentosa Equarius hotel, and Nespresso coffee machine was provided, fully stocked fridge and a sofa for relaxing and enjoying the large window view.
The best part of the hotel is the swimming, first time I use the pool 4 times in 2 days, mainly to dip and enjoying the view towards the city.
Had lunch at LAVO restaurants, don't miss the Truffle Fries and Margherita pizza, and parmigiano sandwhich.
Everyone who ever visited singapore should at least stay here for a day even at high price for the experience.

Tips : Ask for high floor, choose sea view if you want serenity and bayview if you want city skyline. Must not miss the swimming pool, and try the restaurant LAVO, not overly expensive compare to other restaurants nearby","5 years ago on

Helena Tang-Lim,2/5,"Considering this is a 5 star hotel I am extremely disppointed in the appointment of the rooms and house keeping service of the hotel. Granted I had a huge corner room with a wonderful view which was nice but that's where it ends. The finishing was basic and not in the least luxurious. The bed was OK but the bedding lacked the plushness that I would expect from a hotel of this calibre. In particular the duvet felt thin and old.

I truly appreciate that all towels were individually shrink wrapped, probably because of covid right now but it would appear that they have eschewed fabric softener. The towels were old and frankly the roughest I've used in a 5 star hotel.

Sadly the housekeeping was also sadly lacking. The mini bar and snacks were to have been replenished daily. Although the bar was replenished the snacks were not and we had to ask for it. What really surprised me though was the housekeeping staff entered the room without knocking while we were in the room. Used their master key and came right in to bring us our snacks.

Worse, we were rushed to pay for the bill right after the  wines were served. Queued by the waiter (believed to be the floor supervisor) that "" we have long queue of people who waiting to come in"".

iWill,3/5,"Lots of high end shops here. Tourist trap basically. Food court I made piss poor decisions. I got the curry closest to the left as you walk toward it. The taste was a mixture of conflicting spices that made the sauce not so rich and delicious but rather thin, over powering with a bitter/tannin after taste on the tongue. Personally love dipping and would say I have a generally accepting palate for curry and can respect any decent butter chicken, Tika Masala, gram masala etc, but this place was bad. What got me was their fresh cooked tandoori Naan. The Naan was decent, but the butter chicken was just awful. Went to the Ramen joint across the way... poor decision.  It said #1 Ramen in the world... what is wrong with me? Too trusting I guess. Ramen was nothing to write home about. The crispy corn was basically ribbed corn on the cob fried with tapioca or corn starch powder. Lacked flavor. Got seaweed fried for my kiddo, unsalted not crispy... enough said.
Besides my poor food choices, the place was interesting to walk around. The casino is in there if that's a vice u like. All in all, it's like a urban hiking trip. Fun to window shop but you should really hit the hawker center for food. Satay stalls open at 0530pm~ Don't forget to go outside and take pics~

Bryan Cwx,1/5,"Policy and service was really bad, felt like I was going on a staycation at a prison instead. There were staffs stationed at every lift lobby to check our identity before entering, even had to announce our room number when we're exiting the lobby. What's worse is that the staffs infront of the lift lobbies just hate their job. Was told that visitors won't be allowed to enter the hotel after 10pm. My visitor arrived at the lift lobby at 9.50pm and was told ""visitors not allowed to enter after 9.45pm."" and the staff immediately looked away after he finished the sentence. So is brushing someone off the kind of service MBS staffs are taught to provide? I went on to explain that I was told (during registration) that visitors will only be disallowed to enter AFTER 10pm, not 9.45pm, and was told to proceed opposite to use a telephone to speak to the ""front desk"". After which, the operator on the phone told me to proceed to Tower 1 to speak to the staffs at the front desk. So they're basically just asking us to walk back and forth. When I went to the front desk to explain the situation, the staff was polite (thankfully), and apologised for the miscommunication. She then told me that the only thing I can do is to pay $117 add a guest so that there's no restrictions, which I went on to pay the amount given. Afterwhich, I proceeded to bring my guest back to Tower 3 lift lobby, which we were allowed entry this time. However, I heard the staff (which rejected our entry previously) asking his colleague in Bahasa ""Can meh?"" or something similar. This kind of service is what you'll be getting in MBS.

Oh and not to mention that you're only given 6x 500ml of water per day, and when you request for more, it's $5 per bottle.","3 years ago on

Jupiter Baylon,5/5,"I cant contain my excitement to experience Marina Bay Sands Hotel staycation. This establishment is now one of the representation of Singapore and you can find here the magnificient one of a kind infinity pool.

I will share with you some important aspect which i experienced recently.

Room - upon entering the assigned room, you will feel instantly the relax ambience of the unit, maybe because its spacious and interior is well curated. What im impressed most is the curtain will automatically open for you to have a look of its view outside, this is depends whether you have a gardens by the bay or a city view but both sides i believed is amazing. The bed is comfortable definitely your
in to a good night sleep. The linen is fresh, T&B are squeky clean and you all have the things that you may need during your stay.

Staff : as this is a three tower building establishment, a lot of staffing that they need. However, i am so impressed with the staff on how they look after each guest with the request that you are making. There is no delay and a quick reponse coordination among to all department.   In addition to that, they make sure that you are well attended and request is being delivered. A big salute of their team.

Amenities - aside from the regular offering of this hotel, one of the main reasons why tourist or even local singaporean want to experience is the massive infinity pool. It is located on top of the tower, 57th floor to be exact. A truly magnificient view that will make your experience a remarkable one. While enjoying the pool, you will be amazed also with singapore skyline, the towering building, the names of the giant company, the orderly planning of its city. The view will give a peak or even an answer why this little dot is a truly example of a good governance.

If you really want a good staycation, i can highly recommend this property because they do offer most of what you need. From its infinity pool, a mall that most of international brands are present, experienced a hawker style to their makansutra food court which is open 24 hours, nearby tourist spots like garden by the bay, the merlion, esplanade among others, a light show at night, a cafe and restaurant, a casino, or even you want to have a quick run around the area is possible.

If we will tackle about the price, yes it is a bit pricey compare to its nearby hotels, but we need to take note that it is not only the hotel room that are covering, we are also paying a one of a kind experience that will surely remember by its guest.

Marina Bay Sands  perfected the expectation of its hotel guest from a family, group or even solo traveller. I can recommend this to everyone who wants to visit Singapore, a one for the book experience that will give you a story to tell for a lifetime.

With this i am giving this hotel establishment a score of 10 out 10. And i cant wait for my next staycation again 🙏","5 years ago on

Velerie Yeong,4/5,"This place is for the rich.
Everything is awesome here if you have money to blow for a romantic night out to woo a potential partner.
Other than that, everything is too expensive for peasants like us.

There's nothing much to do besides eating and sleeping on a staycation in the hotel besides going to the pool and the gym during this covid19 season. The control to go up is terrible because you're competing with 3 towers of people trying to go up to the pool - which is a must visit due to the awesome view.

They have an automated sms system where you sms this number and issue you a queue number to go up to the pool after 8am. No need to sms from 6 to 8am. But after 8am you have to get a queue number.

On our 1st day, we smsed at 1pm and only got a reply to go up at 10pm, same for the 2nd and 3rd day there even on a weekday. Not very enjoyable but the view is great!","5 years ago on

Betty Siu,5/5,"This mall is very grand, and sprawling and is much more elaborate than usual shopping malls. It is styled after the high-style malls of Las Vegas and like, but along with that is that most of the shops are very high-end (Chanel, Gucci etc) and very tourist-oriented. There are no mid or low-end retail outlets (or very few) and also not that many casual Food and Beverage places like your usual Mr Bean. There is a food court on the end closer to the Art Science Museum and the chicken rice there is about 10 singapore dollars,  and still, very hard to find seats there during peak horus. The square footage is enormous (just like big US malls), and so you can walk very long if you want to go to just one specific shop.  This is a great place to bring visitors from out of town, you can split up and explore the mall for a few hours. The canal boat thing is so tourist and odd ,but i guess very good for photos. In the evening you can enjoy the light show right outside on the waterfront.  And don't forget, Gardens By The Bay is just next door.","Edited 5 years ago on

JoonBond,5/5,"Here are my experiences staying at Marina Bay Sands Hotel Singapore with City View and Garden View. Booth has pros and cons.

Choose City View if you like:
-Beautiful sunset of Singapore Skyline, if the weather is good.
-Cosmopolitan atmosphere with high rise buildings, the city never sleeps. You can view Singapore CBD, and Marina Bay, including Singapore Merlion and The Esplanade.
-A Light and water show at Marina Bay Sands is back, so it is an excellent spot to view the show without squeezing into the crowd.

Choose Garden view if you like:
-To see the beauty of the sunrise.
-Sea view of Singapore straits, including Garden by the Bay, the light show at night time, and Batam Island from far far away.
-Fresh air because the room has a balcony, a good spot for a smoker, you can hang your wet clothes as well, and an excellent place to relax in the late afternoon or evening with the fresh air.

Sang Han,2/5,"Horrible hotel for what you pay. They nickel and dime you whenever they can(i guess, unless you are willing to lose tons of cash at the casino). Check in is unnecessarily long and the staff does not explain terms of stay properly. The welcome staff at Spago are just horrible. Because the check in staff mucked up the process, we were confused about what we were entitled to or not, which the eye-rolling more-entitled staff were either unwillingly or passive-aggressively explaining.

Honorable mentions - Fir (Spago) and Ridwan (Tower 3) - you are both stars. Otherwise, this would have been a 0 star review.

Expect to spend 800 singapore bucks net per night for room. If you can navigate the confusing entitlements scheme (where you sign up to be an MBS Rewards member), you can shave off 70 dollars or so per night. For that same money per night, there are a dozen more deserving and better run hotels in Singapore run by friendly staff who excel at their job of being in the hospitality sector (and deserving of accolades). MBS? No. Hell no.","3 years ago on

Raymond Wee,5/5,"Had an amazing 3d2n stay at this wonderful hotel. Checked in with a down to earth concierge named Cindy.

Initially I thought that checking in would be an intimidating experience as Marina Bay Sands is regarded as one of the world renowned hotel and have a standard to meet, but was pleasantly surprised on how casual and smooth the checking process was.

The room was comfortable and the views were amazing in Tower 2. The only con I could think of is the lack of refrigerator as the one in the room was reserve for the snacks and drinks that they were selling and the fridge has a sensor to track which item was removed and will charge you automatically however that is easily solved by requesting for a personal fridge for a one time fee of $10 SGD

My sister came to Singapore to visit me from Liverpool, UK and we stayed at Marina Bay Sands hotel while she was here.

Havis (pool)
The manager at the pool, ensured that we had all of our needs met and we’re completely happy while poolside.
He has very friendly and professional, ensuring that the guests are well looked after and maintaining a personal interaction. We really appreciated this.

Ridwan (pool)
Again, ensured my sister and I were taken care of and checked on us to ensure all was well. He was a really lovely person, and Havis and him made a great team.

Ryan, Fir, Brandon and Jenny (pool)
What an incredible team of people who take a genuine interest in their guests. They all offered to take pictures for us and didn’t rush us whatsoever. Their presence at the pool made sure that my sister and I felt comfortable and content the entire time we were guests on the roof.

Nelly (Spa)
I had a facial with Nelly and was blown away by the care and time taken. She truly knows her craft and the treatment pleasantly included a foot bath and mini head and shoulder massage.
Nelly made me feel completely at ease and it felt so luxurious the entire way through.
She also gave practical tips and advice on how to maintain my skincare following the treatment, not pushing to buy products as I have had before. This will remain one of my favourite facial treatments for a long time.

From the upscale shopping mall, casino, Sky Park Observation Deck to the surrounding public areas, it is a fantastic place to explore. The boat rides available inside the mall are reminiscent of the gondolas at The Venetian in Las Vegas. The smaller version of the Changi Jewel is just as impressive to watch. And the nightly water show on the bay is more spectacular than the Bellagio's in Vegas.

Serena S,5/5,"World Class Service! Highly recommended for anyone who believes top service is imperative to an enjoyable stay. Some parts of the hotel may not be spanking new (eg balcony tiles), but we were beyond satisfied by the excellence in customer service during our stay - certainly reason enough to want to come back again! Whenever we called with any concern (bathroom, pool slot and belongings left behind), this was not only addressed professionally, but empathetically and most swiftly.

I must say, for a massive hotel, Marina Bay Sands Singapore really has surprised us with the impeccable standard of guest relations.

Google",Google,2025-09-13 13:42:03,error,"World Class Service! Highly recommended for anyone who believes top service is imperative to an enjoyable stay. Some parts of the hotel may not be spanking new (eg balcony tiles), but we were beyond satisfied by the excellence in customer service during our stay - certainly reason enough to want to come back again! Whenever we called with any concern (bathroom, pool slot and belongings left behind), this was not only addressed professionally, but empathetically and most swiftly.

I must say, for a massive hotel, Marina Bay Sands Singapore really has surprised us with the impeccable standard of guest relations. They clearly have guest satisfaction at top priority and therefore understood inside out, leaving even the most discerning guest impressed and assured to have an enjoyable, memorable time.

Room No.: 4089

This is our first time staying with Marina Bay Sands Singapore. We had a wonderful experience in these 3 days. Every staff members I encountered from the valets, bellmen, housekeepers, slot ambassadors to concierge ambassadors, they were performing excellent services and eager to help us out anytime. Our room was spacious and spotless with good garden view. We enjoyed a lot at the infinity pool, jacuzzi and skypark. Suggest the time of your jacuzzi sessions can be extended from 15min to 30 min.

Unfortunately, only one of your front desk receptionists was really made us speechless and fedup just upon the day we check-in.

We were served by counter 4 at about 2:30pm-2:45pm. We need to fill up a form for check-in purpose. I believe that she still a NEWBIE?

I was checking with my fiance if the name is written correctly, how dare she giving us a rude comment by asking,  ""你男朋友的全名你也不知道啊？""

We were stunned and totally can't believe that we just received an insult gift from a FIVE stars hotel receptionist, just the first day we check-in.

Things were not getting better but getting worse instead.

My fiance mentioned to her that we were actually getting married tomorrow. No blessings received, another unexpected words came out from her mouth AGAIN. She looked at my finger and said I was not even wearing ANY RING. She told me that I should wear my ring so she can know that I AM ENGAGED.

Another rude comments from her mouth by saying, “Waaaa, your husband soon but you don't know his full name.“

This is how a FIVE stars hotel, Marina Bay Sands provided us an unforgettable first impression. =) Thanks to her. Management should train her more about MANNERS and COMMON SENSE before assign her to serve your valued guests. I believe that she was not well-trained enough.

⭐⭐⭐⭐
We will definitely be back for staycation but certaintly hope that we won't receive such rude comments to start off our day again.","3 years ago on

Fidelis Woo,1/5,"Got re-directed from Carpark South to loading/unloading bay carpark convention hall due to some event ongoing. This parking had a fixed rate of about $9. Enquired about using rewards card to redeem parking and one of the attendants told me it was the same as regular parking.

Upon redeeming points for parking, I was told at the barrier that I had to present the receipt instead of the card. Unfortunately, the receipt was with my sister and she had left earlier. I also had a picture of proof receipt. With no chance of redeeming the parking coupon, I was forced to pay about $9 of parking. They told me I could claim back $4 the next time I come or through email. Howevern that would mean in the end I would still be losing time and money to go through all the hassle when I redeemed a full amount of $27 for the parking.

It was unjust and unfair as there wasn't any notice to present receipt upon leaving as you could just redeem using the rewards card at the usual carpark south. It was due to poor communication from the management. To make it aware to customers using the carpark. If I had known, I would gladly have parked at the other carpark entrances.

Utterly disappointed as they could have helped me instead of leaving me with no option but to pay the full fee. Be warned if they redirect you elsewhere!!!","3 years ago on

Magnificent view and spacious (upgraded category) however it came with an outdated and old fashion interior design with a ventilation pillar in the middle (??).  The shower was always in rather hot temperature and it took at least 5 minutes to turn less hotter.

I was rather disappointed that a 5 star property does not provide a bathtub (??!!).  Went to the hot pool at Tower 2 and needed to transfer at L1, with the Covid19 checkin/checkout procedure in a bathrobe.  Was advised that only swimsuit is allowed in the hot pool as towel will contaminate the water but BYO swimsuit will not (!!??).

And somehow I could hardly sleep for 2 nights and decided to checkout at approx 6am on 3rd day.

I will not pay SGD400 to SGD500 for such a below average stay.","4 years ago on

The staff were wonderful and accomodating, remembering my name and addressed me by it each time they came to the table. The lunch buffet was amazing with so much choice, it's a self service buffet so you could try anything you fancied. The seafood station was amazing and I could have filled up there. The deserts were to die for and the chef was very accomodating in cutting me half portions from two cakes as I was spoilt for choice. I look bed the cordial station as well where you could add fruit. A lovely experience, would thoroughly recommend and will definitely return.","5 years ago on

Tammy Koo,1/5,"I am extremely disappointed and shameless with my experience at Koma Marina Bay Sand.

About 1 month back, I made an appointment for January 12, 2023. Have introduced my contact from Australia and highly recommended him to try Japanese food at Koma.

He was wearing expensive designer sandals due to his leg injury on that day. When we reached Koma's entrance, a lady at the reception stopped and told us strictly that the dress code policy is ""Gentlemen must wear closed shoes and long trousers"" and ""Ladies and gentlemen, don't wear flip flops."". She restricted us with two options on either buying a new pair of closed shoes for admission or just simply cancel the appointment off. We were utterly unbearable and impossible to communicate and negotiate with her in the absence of customer servicing at all.

Does the policy discriminate and not welcome people who wear sandals and with disabilities? If this is the standing, please properly state and spell out clearly within the policy that sandals are not strictly allowed. I can say that ""Policy is fixed, but human mindset is alive"". Should Koma staff don't change their mentality and remain inflexible, ""customer service"" can hardly be labelled. Unfortunately, I encounter such unpleasant experience at Koma.

We faced with entrance rejection flatly for Koma dining and left with no choice but visit another eatery - Bistro & Oyster Bar. Despite the fact that receptionist over there mentioned the dress code policy as well, they wholeheartedly understood, showed empathy and accepted my contact's medical disabilities without any trace of discrimination. I seriously in doubt on how well establishment and highly prestige Koma assumes and rates itself but nevertheless in my opinion, Bistro & Oyster Bar offers a much more professional customer service and provide appetizing food.

With such a terrible and awful experience, I will not recommend anyone and visit Koma again. I do sincerely hope that the Management of Marina Bay Sands can advise your Partners/Tenants to provide more professional flexible and customer services and allow customers to enjoy their good moments when shopping and dining at Marina Bay Sands.","2 years ago on

Greg Maunder,5/5,"Spectacular views from L42 (Deluxe King Sky View).

The Hotel is an imposing and spectacular sight from many locations in Singapore and just as spectacular looking out from the Hotel rooms.

The Deluxe King Sky View Room is spacious, exceptionally well appointed, very clean and comfortable.

There is a bar fridge which is full of stock, leaving no room for storing your own items - be aware the bar fridge has electronic sensors and any item removed (even if you are just checking out the item), is charged to your room.

If you want a personal bar fridge for storing your own items, you can do so for $10; delivered to your room!

Included in the cost of the room is access to the Sands SkyPark Observation Deck and Infinity Pool, with the latter restricted to hotel guests only. Access is strictly enforced, so ensure you carry your access card at all times. Not sure about access to the Sands SkyPark Observation Deck, but access to the Infinity Pool ceases immediately upon check-out.

The  Sands SkyPark Observation Deck is open to the public and entry is approximately S$23 for adults and S$12 for children.

A highlight of the Sands SkyPark Observation Deck is the nightly 15 minute display of Spectra – A Light & Water Show. Runs 8pm & 9pm Sun-Thu and 8pm, 9pm and 10pm Fri-Sat.","Edited 5 years ago on

Linda L,4/5,"UPDATE: after a discussion we were offered an upgrade to the Orchid Suite for a good discount and from that moment on the whole experience turned around. The suite included the club facilities we wanted and granted us preferred slots for the pool as well. The extra costs were definitely worth it and the whole Marina Bay Sands experience was amazing. So my tip: book a suite to get the best service.
--------------------------------------
We are supposed to arrive tomorrow in Marina Bay Sands, but until now everything is going wrong. We booked a clubroom on the website in the beginning of August. Today I find out the system did not book us a clubroom. What I did: after selecting clubroom and then date, I selected the roomtype. Turns out these are not clubrooms because they are not available. But there wasn't any sign on the website that informed me I was not booking a website. When talking to reservations today I was not offered help, instead I was informed repeatedly (approx 15-20 times) the clubroom was not available anymore. I got that the first time. But I was not offered a solution. The problem created by the hotel's website was made my problem. Not the kind of customer service you expect from a 5 star hotel with high prices.
Then I read the email I received at 9.17 this morning about prebooking the pool and check-in time. By the time I filled out of the information like names, confirmation and pasport numbers, I received the available slots. I was flabbergasted. More than 24 hours before our arrival I was only to book 1 slot on Sunday for the pool: from 6.00-7.15 AM!!!! Are you kidding me? I hope the hotel will arrange a suitable solution. Fingers crossed. This is unacceptable for a 5 star hotel with price starting at 500 SGD per night.","Edited 4 years ago on

A chinese-speaking lady who's helping at the queue seemed to have communication issues - instead of showing hospitality and professionalism, she portrayed sarcasm. We are aware that we missed the queue but she had to keep reiterating it without giving us a solution initially. It's only after we asked whether we can get another queue number (solution came from us?) and she exclaimed rudely: ""YES I WILL GIVE YOU AND I'M ARRANGING IT FOR YOU NOW!"" She speaks English but had a thick Chinese accent. Eventually we gotten sort of a service recovery when we were ushered into the VIP Guests Services Lounge for checking in. Staff in there were nice.

Lobby services (concierge, bellboy, carpark valet etc) - 1/5: Ordered Grabfood but items went missing. 0 communications between departments and 0 hospitality given to my wife. The staff simply asked my wife to check on her own. A simple call or maybe thru walkie talkies can be really helpful no? Ended up making my wife ran (literally) from tower 1 to 3 and back to tower 1. Shouldn't all staff simply direct her to the concierge to assist?

Room service - 3/5: After finally retrieving our food, we called to request for cutleries but it didn't came until like 30 mins later. Had to call in twice to chase for it.

Pool - 5/5: Compliments to a staff at the pool gantry who's especially nice and friendly - forgotten his name sadly.

Cindy Leong,1/5,"My husband and kids visited MBS today and took a ride on the sampan ride ($13 per person). It was a very enjoyable ride and both kids had a lot of fun.

As soon as they alighted, my 2 year old was handed a plastic photo snow globe with their pictures in it. Being a 2 year old, he obviously wanted to keep it despite us not wanting to purchase it. We ended up paying $30 for a piece of plastic with low resolution pictures in it.

What a dirty trick to sell souvenirs to tourists - through child manipulation. I encourage you to skip the sampan ride. If you absolutely must ride it, watch out for the scam artist that will slip a souvenir into the hands of your child so you’re manipulated to purchase it.

I will not be visiting this tourist trap again.","3 years ago on

andyloe,1/5,"Child fell at the stairs at the entrance of the pool and bleed profusely. None of the staff, not even the lifeguard who witnessed the bleeding took initiative to call for a first aid kit. Thank goodness my friend who is first aid trained shouted for the kit and did first aid treatment on her own. This is a clear indication that the staff were not prepared for emergency. Following this event, poor communication among staff surfaced. We were told to wait in the room and a car/taxi will be called for us to the hospital. It did not happened. 3 different staff came but none had context or had called for a taxi.
Child had a total of 10 stitches.

Ice Qu,5/5,"When I need a stroll. Indoors. With air conditioning.  With interesting people watching. With an airy feeling. With deluxe super lux luxury stores! This is where I go. I often walk so much I get blisters on my feet and don't care. So much to see! Every big name fashion house, every sparkly bauble and watch store, celebrity chef eatery, yup. Tis all here. Do consider dressing up slightly when you visit. A tourist in a tube top and holey shorts plus dirty flipflops looks, feels, and (sorry) smells out of place here. This is where you go to get your glam on. Do it! Enjoy the experience, even if you buy nothing.
They also have a huge eating area on one of the lower levels, toy and clothing stores, and for families with kids, an astounding electronic whimsical sort of skate rink (no ice, your feet moving affects a design on the floor).
If you like architecture,  inside and out this place should be studied. It is truly a marvel. Love it for the openness, the designer shops, the modern fabulousness and especially for over the top nice, helpful and friendly concierge desks who will help you along the way.","5 years ago on

Mustafa Danial,2/5,"Booking system for the pool and gym seems like a bad school project which is all show and zero comprehensive action.

Tried to book the gym, it was full. Went over to see. Saw enough people to fit into two grab cars.

Apparently people can book in advance, don't attend, the staff there can't handle bookings that don't turn up and this silly system process flaw makes it difficult for others to enjoy one the bigger selling points of mbs. Amenities are not as great as I thought. If you're not good with mandarin, prepare Google translate on ur phone. Housekeeping will by default speak to you in mandarin. Tried and tested with different people with varying degrees of skin colour.

I Guess the only good thing is the view.","4 years ago on

1- They allow 1 mobile number 1 queue. And receptionist say can write the total PAX to go.  But the gym insist only 1 person to go. Funny is another person had to queue again. Doesnt it more risk to get same room person to join another queue to book?

2- They didnt inform upfront the infinity Pool is full until you book.

3- The queue is call up once your turn, so i cannot preplan my event of day and had to sit there wait for queue whole day in room?

You can just come to have a stroll in it and enjoy free drinks (wide choice of soft drinks, and hot beverages). Strictly no pics in the casino. No dress code required. To enter and to exit you need to go through security check, so passport for tourists and ID for locals is required. Singaporean citizen needs to pay in order to enter the casino, whereas it is free entry for everybody else. The place developed in two floors and is divided into smoking area and no-smoking area.

Gloria Khine,3/5,"Had 4D3N staycation. Everything was good EXCEPT hiccups upon checkin with reward card updates! Really a bummer on arrival!!!!!

We had to go back and forth multiple times between Checkin-out counter and Rewards counter.
There is also a disconnect between room side and rewards side. Room side said we could claim Another 60bucks from 3rd night. But rewards side said it is not applicable.
Info given to guests should be consistent.

Upon checkout as well, card rewards point are not updated while we can see on apps. Checkout counter indian lady is so rude in the way she told us that there is no point in the card. Will we ask for points offset when there is zero?

Really unpleasant experience dealing with 2 set of people. Other than these 2sets of people, rest is pretty good.

We decided to ignore and didn't say anything but checkout experience made us lose our limit and write our unpleasant experience.

It is a shame that our experience is ruined by these 2 sets of people.","4 years ago on

stephen,3/5,"Parking at shoppes is horrific. They don't notify car drivers their parking lots are full, resulting in spending money just to drive into the car parking circling around. The parking design is horrific with only one way traffic flows. Many people come with cars because of the free parking with a very low minimum spend like 50$.

Never come here unless you are a tourist or if you must come , come via taxi.

And of course this place is for tourists.","4 years ago on

Catherine Lim,1/5,"Bad bad experience. While checking in, we were informed by the staff at check in counter that it’s possible to pre-register a friend who’s visiting us on all 3 days of our stay. However, when our friend visited us on the 2nd day, he was denied access, as his name was not in the system and another staff at the check in counter informed us that “pre-registering of visitors is NOT ALLOWED”. In the end, we had to queue at the check in counter to register our friend every single day. While I understand that the restrictions put in place are to safeguard the hotel stayers, it’s absolutely disappointing to see the lack of SOPs from a five star hotel.

That aside, i called the express service in the morning to request for additional bottled water, as there were 3 adults staying but was told that additional charges apply. Totally unacceptable!","4 years ago on

Could not go back to my room with my wife n kid, cause i was registered as the visitor. Literally from a fantastic weekend turned a nightmare, got chased out of my hotel room.

The check in counter lady literately have the compassion and ego, to ask me come back the next day, leaving my wife and kid to stay at the room by themselves.

That just sums up my family staycation for the weekend, we just head home in the wee hours.

Verdict:
Get your infomation and registeration done right, if not will not recommend you staying. Not family centric nor have the compassion to consideration the customer circumstances.

Then again glad i took the bullet, will not recommend my customers or foreign guest to stay there.","3 years ago on

We were there for the New Year's Eve fireworks along with thousands of tourists. Pushing through the crowds was quite the norm. The subways ran on a special schedule to handle the large crowds. After the fireworks, we went to the air conditioned food court to have cold drinks (teh peng at 1am) as it was quite hot and sticky outside watching the fireworks surrounded by people and felt no breezes at all. Had to do this once in my lifetime. Probably wouldn't do this again here. On to the next New Year's Eve celebration.","6 years ago on

The view for our room was amazing and the MBS crew had kindly prepared cakes to celebrate my parents anniversary.

Unfortunately, the TV set seems to be worn out and kept freezing every 10 to 15 mins with poor resolution. It would have been perfect to have a smart TV for us to connect our tablet wirelessly and stream our favourite shows.","3 years ago on

The amenities are kind of average, especially with bottle juices and Lay's chips. They are stingy in replenishing the fridge, only a small pack of Lay's per day. We asked for extra pack of chips and the customer service said we'd have to pay for it.
The king size bed is kind of small compared to the Carlton bras Basah. They gave covid19 carepack with mask holder case and wipe. but there were two guests and only one carepack given.

It is a tiny country, really easy and convenient to go around pero it's dollar besh. Haha 🤣. It is one of the most expensive countries to visit in Southeast Asia pero it's worth it. ❤️

Best thing to do: Chill in the Marina bay at night - just like what we did. Romantic masyado. 🤣❤️

Daniel,5/5,"It is the MBS. The most atas mall in Singapore. I love how straightforward the layout is. Making it very easy to navigate. High ends brands, and from mid-range to luxury (up to $700 per pax) are here. Casinos, Venice inspired canoes ride, waterfall, gigantic chandelier. If there’s an improvement needed, it’s the guard staff who does the covid scanning. They’re rather rude.","4 years ago on

Edwin S,5/5,"This is a very high-end mall located in close proximity of the Gardens by the Bay and Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Quite a few high-end brands, such as Hermes, Louis Vuitton, are present here. The mall has a very high floor-to-floor distance, which gives it a very luxe feeling.

For dining options, there are food court (Rasapura Masters), and several famous restaurants (Black Tap, Din Tai Fung, Bread Street Kitchen).

At several timings, there are also a show on the river called Spectra. It is a 15-minutes light and sound show.

The mall is also linked to the Bayfront MRT which gives it a very easy access.","5 years ago on

The Travelling Ambivert,4/5,"If you're interested in abstract, towering architecture combined with an overwhelming number of restaurants and shops, Marina Bay Sands is the destination for you. If you have the chance, also head to the Sky Deck for views of Singapore.

The ship-like top level of the building connected by its three towers, are a sight to behold. It does leave you quite overwhelmed with the sheer size and scale of the complex. It's worth heading over to this location as a part of the Marina Bay area overall, but I found The Shoppes to be similar to any major mall and wouldn't spend any particular time here. Shopping enthusiasts of high-end and luxury labels will be spoilt for choice by what feels like an endless supply of shopping outlets and restaurants.

There are some great art installations dotted around the complex, including a fantastic interactive piece by teamLab, which responds to pressure points that visitors stand on (a favourite of young children).

Footpaths on the main road are nearly non-existent (aside from pedestrian areas) and requires using the shopping mall to get around the Marina Bay area. Pass through The Shoppes to get to the MRT station and surrounding attractions such as Gardens by the Bay and the ArtScience Museum.","6 years ago on

John Kearns,1/5,"Old slot machines. Poor selection. Can't breathe on the bottom floor from all the smokers. There is literally not a single bar in the casino! To get a beer you are put through a drawn out process that takes around 15 minutes. I did a full circuit of the bottom floor and I kid you not, not 1 single person had an Alcoholic drink. Not a single 1! I'm guessing the locals gave up trying to order one in frustration. I will give 1 star for the huge jackpots. Some liklnk up machines are over 1 million dollars.","5 years ago on

Vincent Lee,4/5,"A high-end mall residing within an architecturally beautiful structure with Marina Bay, the Gardens by the Bay and the financial district as her backdrop depending on where you are.

Proper placement of signages are helpful in this huge retail heaven. There is a food court at one end (near to the ArtScience Museum), and also an indoor sampan (a beautifully crafted Chinese wooden boat) ride for a fee if you prefer to window shop while floating through the mall.

There is a nightly light show facing the Esplanade, giving shopper an opportunity to wind down after shopping. The evening breeze can be enjoyable as well despite Singapore's balmy weather.

The place is well connected to other places of interest like the Gardens by the Bay, the ArtScience Museum, and more shopping destinations on the other end of the Helix Bridge.","Edited 6 years ago on

Better to go to Suntec City (one stop over) for a variety of ""accessible"" stores.

If you have a high budget, MBS is undoubtedly your spot.","5 years ago on

The explorer suite for a family with 2 young children is amazing.
Everyone is very paying attention to details.
Even the wait for the breakfast buffet is well managed even by rainy day when the sitting is limited.

Johann DG,5/5,"Every time I visit Marina Bay Sands, it just never gets old. The whole place has that wow factor — from the architecture to the views to the atmosphere. Whether you’re here to dine, shop, relax, or just walk around and take in the sights, it really feels like you’re in the heart of Singapore.

I’ve been here a few times, sometimes just to chill with colleagues or bring visiting friends around. The vibe is classy but still welcoming. The views from the observation deck or even just around the promenade area are incredible, especially at night when the skyline lights up.

Even if you’re not staying at the hotel, there’s so much to explore — the Shoppes, the food court, the canal, and of course the light and water show outside. It’s one of those places you always end up coming back to, whether for the experience or to just enjoy the scenery.","3 months ago on

**Inspire one
🌟 ""Not every dream fades when you wake up.""**

Last night, I had a dream.

I was surrounded by warmth and wonders—a world where everything felt possible.

The most fascinating part? I was at Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Tower 3, on a high floor. Standing by the edge of infinity, I gazed at a horizon that seemed to stretch forever.

When I woke up, I realized something amazing.

The dream stayed with me.

It reminded me how moments of awe can bring clarity and spark new ideas. Our surroundings play such an important role in shaping our emotions, thoughts, and even our dreams. And sometimes, those dreams gently nudge us to aim higher, to explore further, and to truly embrace the wonder around us.

I woke up inspired.

gilang fathur,5/5,"Got nothing to do during night in Singapore? Try marina bay!

It's a really really good place to enjoy the evening and experience the night life in Singapore. Take a walk around the marina bay and seeing all the crowds and lights are really hyping you up.
The skyline is also amazing here, you can spend the night just chilling watching the skyline or seeing what the crowds are up to, sometimes there's a performance from dance groups all over the city there.

One thing that you shouldn't miss is definitely the spektra light show. It's an amazing light show with water and laser projectors creating an amazing show that runs about 10-15 minutes. A perfect night with family or partner","a month ago on

Madhuram Sabari,5/5,"Didn’t get a chance to stay at Marina Bay Sands, but just seeing it from the outside was a stunning experience. The architecture is iconic and instantly recognizable — it truly dominates the Singapore skyline in the most elegant way.

The way the SkyPark spans across the three towers is incredible to see up close. At night, the building comes alive with beautiful lights and reflections on the bay. The surrounding area is also lively with great views, walkways, and photo spots.

Even without staying inside, it’s a landmark worth visiting — a must-see when in Singapore.","a month ago on

Rosanne Woodcraft,5/5,"From the moment you step into Marina Bay Sands, you’re wrapped in pure luxury. Every detail is meticulously thought out — from the grand lobby with its sweeping architecture to the impeccable service that anticipates your every need. The rooms are elegant and spacious, with breathtaking views of the city skyline or the bay, and the plush beds make it hard to leave.

The iconic infinity pool alone is worth the stay — floating at the top of the world with Singapore stretched out before you feels like a dream. The restaurants are world-class, offering everything from fine dining to global cuisines, all served with precision and flair.

Whether you're shopping in the high-end boutiques, relaxing at the spa, or simply soaking in the beauty of the design, Marina Bay Sands doesn’t miss a beat. It’s more than just a hotel — it’s an experience in flawless luxury and stunning attention to detail. Absolutely gorgeous from top to bottom.","2 months ago on

John SCN,5/5,"This is a review of MBS Hotel’s newly launched Aperitif Hour at 6 different restaurants based at MBS
————————————————————————-
In Jun 2025, MBS launched the Aperitif Hour ( 5pm-7pm ) at 6 restaurants based at MBS hotel and mall. This replaces the Evening Canapés ( which was available only at MBS hotel ).

The Aperitif Hour ( 5pm-7pm ), plus Breakfast ( 6.30am-10am ) and afternoon tea ( 3pm-5pm ) are made available FOC to guests staying in certain room types.

In the past 5 weeks, I have tried 5 of the restaurants that participated in the Aperitif Hour. Of the 5 restaurants, I tried 2 of them twice, because they are just so good.

My reviews, in descending order of ranking , are as follows :-

1.Bread Street Kitchen ( BSK )
———————————————-
I tried BSK twice over 5 weeks.
Of all the Aperitif Hour participating restaurants, this is the BEST ! 👍👍👍

Even though it was only 5pm, the restaurant has a busy and vibrant feel, with courteous staff attending to the needs of diners, who are happily chatting away. This is a happy place 😀😀😀.

Being a Gordon Ramsay restaurant, the food is, of course, very good. I am very happy that they served their in-house focaccia bread ( with humus ) first, before the arrival of our main orders of Sunday Roast Yorkies, Mini Fish & Chips, and Wagyu Burger Sliders. The delicious focaccia and humus makes the wait for the main orders so much bearable 😜.

Even though it is supposed to be Aperitif Hour, the food BSK served is of such a good size that we skipped dinner thereafter.

The Wagyu Burger Sliders are so good, that we ordered it both times we are there. ( My dining companion thinks it can give Cut’s Wagyu Sliders a run for their money, but I have to, ahem, differ lah 😅 ).

Even though we did not order any alcoholic beverages ( it’s part of the package ), I note they have a wide selection for connoisseurs. The non-alcoholic Ginger De Pooh, and Belini Junior are refreshingly good.

I will return to BSK for Aperitif Hour or a main meal during my next stay at MBS. 😋😋😋

2.Wakuda
—————-
I also tried Wakuda twice over 5 weeks.

Wakuda has an understated and quiet elegance. At 5pm, it’s not crowded or busy ( unlike BSK ), and I think many diners may like Wakuda exactly for that.

Being a sister restaurant to Waku Ghin, its food is very good. I have dined there many times, so having Aperitif Hour at Wakuda allows me to have a different experience there.

I really like their Wagyu Cigar, which is yummy 😋. Their Karage Chicken is extra crispy and delicious .

Wakuda is a really good restaurant.
I will definitely return for a sumptuous dinner with close friends and family… soon.

3.Koma
————-
When I am served with the food , I am blown away by their presentation… it came on a mini version of their iconic bridge ( which is the backdrop of countless photos of many diners there ). What a nice touch. 👍

We had the Aperitif Hour at the Bar Lounge instead of the main dining area. The wagyu slider is very good but the portions are relatively small.

I look forward to return to Koma for a main meal again.

4.Yardbird
——————
The quality of the food is good, and the portions are big enough that I skipped dinner thereafter.

I am surprised by the quality and spread of the food at Yardbird, which I have never visited before. I may now visit Yardbird in the near future.
At 5pm, the restaurant is relativity quiet.

5.Maison Boulud
—————————
When I arrived at 5pm, the service staff  assigned me a seat near a window which is scorching hot from the afternoon sun.

The food portions are very small and the quality average.

The restaurant itself is very quiet, with only 2 staff serving customers at 5pm.

The newly introduced Aperitif Hour is a brilliant idea !!!

This gives the hotel guests a chance to try the excellent food served by the restaurants based at the mall and hotel. Also, it provides the restaurants some business during the quiet hour of 5pm-6pm. A win-win-win for all. 👍👍👍

I look forward to Aperitif Hour being introduced at Cut, Spago, Black Tap etc. 😀😀😀","2 months ago on

Lin Frank,2/5,"I stayed at Marina Bay Sands from July 3rd for five days and four nights with my family. Unfortunately, it was a disappointing experience.

On the first day, we waited for two full hours during check-in because the hotel said our room had a smoke odor. As compensation, we were given USD 150.

However, on the second night, we noticed the room still had a strong smell of smoke. The manager brought in a machine, saying it used a “natural solution” to remove the odor. I told them this was unacceptable—we have a child, and we couldn’t tolerate this for the rest of our holiday. I requested a room change or an upgrade, but the manager only said they would report it and then completely ignored us afterward.

This is the second time this year we’ve stayed here as a family, but sadly, it will be the last. A hotel of this level should take better care of its guests.","2 months ago on

oXRYSTALo Ong,5/5,"Marina Bay Sands Hotel Suites: The Best Birthday Ever! (4.5/5 stars)

Ratings:

• Accommodation: 5/5 (Breathtaking suite, spacious, impeccably designed, stunning views, plush furnishings)

• Service: 4.5/5 (Generally impeccable, friendly and attentive staff, minor delay in room service)

• Amenities: 5/5 (Exceptional dining options, unforgettable Sands Skypark infinity pool)

• Overall: 4.5/5

The best birthday ever! My amazing boyfriend, Donkey, surprised me with a stay at the luxurious MBS Hotel Suites, and the entire experience was pure bliss! From the moment we arrived, we were enveloped in an atmosphere of unparalleled elegance and sophistication. The suite itself was breathtaking & spacious, impeccably designed, and boasting floor to ceiling windows offering stunning panoramic views of the city skyline and Gardens by the Bay. The plush furnishings, state of the art amenities (I especially loved the deep-soaking tub!), and the sheer opulence of the space created an unforgettable experience. Simply relaxing and enjoying the breathtaking views was pure bliss. The service was generally impeccable, the staff were friendly, attentive, and always ready to assist with a smile. Dining at one of the hotel's many exceptional restaurants was a highlight, and the Sands Skypark infinity pool provided an unforgettable backdrop for a celebratory swim.  The only minor drawback was a slight delay in room service, we requested shower gel via the in-room TV system and waited approximately 45 minutes before having to call directly to expedite the request.

Ratings:

• Accommodation: 5/5 (Breathtaking suite, spacious, impeccably designed, stunning views, plush furnishings)

• Service: 4.5/5 (Generally impeccable, friendly and attentive staff, minor delay in room service)

• Amenities: 5/5 (Exceptional dining options, unforgettable Sands Skypark infinity pool)

• Overall: 4.5/5

The best birthday ever! My amazing boyfriend, Donkey, surprised me with a stay at the luxurious MBS Hotel Suites, and the entire experience was pure bliss! From the moment we arrived, we were enveloped in an atmosphere of unparalleled elegance and sophistication. The suite itself was breathtaking & spacious, impeccably designed, and boasting floor to ceiling windows offering stunning panoramic views of the city skyline and Gardens by the Bay. The plush furnishings, state of the art amenities (I especially loved the deep-soaking tub!), and the sheer opulence of the space created an unforgettable experience. Simply relaxing and enjoying the breathtaking views was pure bliss. The service was generally impeccable, the staff were friendly, attentive, and always ready to assist with a smile. Dining at one of the hotel's many exceptional restaurants was a highlight, and the Sands Skypark infinity pool provided an unforgettable backdrop for a celebratory swim.  The only minor drawback was a slight delay in room service, we requested shower gel via the in-room TV system and waited approximately 45 minutes before having to call directly to expedite the request. However, this small inconvenience was easily overshadowed by the overall magnificence of our stay. Overall, the MBS Hotel Suites delivered an extraordinary experience, making it the most memorable birthday celebration ever. I highly recommend it for anyone seeking a truly luxurious and unforgettable getaway."
Gokhan Ozturk,4/5,"Marina Bay Sands is an iconic landmark in Singapore with breathtaking views from the SkyPark, especially at sunset. The hotel itself is impressive, with luxurious amenities and a stunning infinity pool. However, the place can get crowded, especially during peak hours, and some areas feel a bit too commercialized. The prices for food and services are on the higher side, but you’re paying for the experience. Overall, it’s a must-visit for anyone looking to experience luxury and amazing views in Singapore, but be prepared for the crowds and premium prices.","4 months ago on

Jenny Bloomfield,5/5,"We enjoyed an anniversary trip to MBS. We live in Singapore so it was a treat for us to leave the kids for a couple of nights to staycation there. We stayed in one of the newly upgraded rooms and it was stunning. We were treated like royalty! The staff gave us a bottle of bubbles and a cake for our celebration, and there wasn't one thing we would change about our stay. The new rooms are gorgeous, and have one of the most beautiful bathrooms I've been in. Cannot speak highly enough about the ""new"" MBS - I never felt the old rooms really lives up to the price tag, but the new ones definitely do.","a month ago on

Grower David,5/5,"An Unforgettable Experience at Marina Bay, Singapore!

Marina Bay is truly the heart of modern Singapore. The skyline is absolutely breathtaking, especially at night when the city lights reflect beautifully off the bay. The entire area is impeccably clean, safe, and well-organized—perfect for a relaxing stroll or a romantic evening.

Highlights for me included the Marina Bay Sands SkyPark with its stunning panoramic views, the Spectra Light & Water Show, and the Gardens by the Bay, especially the Supertree Grove. There's also fantastic dining nearby, from street food to fine restaurants with amazing views.

It’s a perfect blend of nature, technology, and luxury. Whether you’re a tourist or a local, Marina Bay offers something memorable for everyone. Highly recommended!","2 months ago on

Kim Tey,5/5,"Iconic and Luxurious Experience!

Marina Bay Sands is an absolute gem in Singapore! The hotel, the infinity pool, and the observation deck – everything is top-notch. The view from the SkyPark is breathtaking, especially at sunset or night when the whole city lights up. The infinity pool on the 57th floor? Totally worth the hype – you feel like you're swimming in the sky.

The shopping mall downstairs is full of high-end brands, and the dining options are fantastic – perfect if you’re looking for something a bit fancy. The whole complex feels so luxurious and is a great spot to take photos.

Even if you're not staying at the hotel, visiting the observation deck or enjoying the rooftop is a must-do when in Singapore.","3 months ago on

Staff was almost ""overpolite"".

Very hard to find a table for work, and you are not supposed to sit to work in those restaurants anyway. I found a stairs near the subway station for my work~

Andrew Germanos,5/5,"Marina Bay Sands is one of the most iconic and breathtaking destinations in Singapore — a true architectural marvel that lives up to the hype. The moment you arrive, you're struck by how clean, modern, and well-maintained the entire area is. It’s obvious the government has invested heavily in making this part of the city not only efficient but also visually stunning.

The complex itself has everything: a luxury hotel, a massive shopping mall, world-class restaurants, the ArtScience Museum, a casino, and the famous SkyPark Infinity Pool with panoramic views of the city skyline. At night, the entire bay lights up beautifully, creating an unforgettable atmosphere. The nightly light and water shows are truly a spectacle, adding to the area’s magical charm.

Marina Bay Sands is also very tourist-friendly. Once you’ve walked around a bit or used the MRT nearby, getting your bearings becomes easy. The area feels safe, accessible, and full of energy.

We were incredibly lucky to visit while Singapore was preparing for its 60th National Day celebrations. We witnessed military rehearsals, fighter jets soaring overhead, and stunning fireworks lighting up the bay. Combined with the elegance of Marina Bay Sands, it made for a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

Highly recommended for any visitor to Singapore.

Zoei Zhang,5/5,"Went there a couple of days ago for the fireworks display during the NDP rehearsals. It was so well organised despite being super crowded.

I drove there via the south parking entrance and we were directed to park our cars in the expo hall/loading bay. They opened all the expo halls and converted it into a massive carpark instead 😆 the staff members allocated spaces to each car so the process was very quick and efficient.

After the fireworks display, to facilitate human traffic and to maintain safety, they closed some doors in the middle of the mall so that people don’t rush in from all directions from outdoors to indoors and have to follow the same direction for exiting.","a month ago on

Himanshu Johari,5/5,"We booked a stay at Marina Bay Sands to celebrate my son’s birthday — it was his dream to swim in the infinity pool, and we wanted to make it unforgettable. I booked two suites for our family, kids, and nieces so everyone could be part of the celebration.

The rooms and the pool were simply amazing, and the kids had the time of their lives. But what truly stood out was the exceptional service, especially from Erica, who gave us a check-in experience unlike anything I’ve had before.

We were greeted right at the car and taken directly to our suite, where the kids were welcomed with chocolates and apples. While the little ones ran around, excited and full of joy, my family and I completed the check-in formalities in the comfort of our room — no queues, no waiting, just pure ease.

From start to finish, everything about our stay was thoughtful, seamless, and special. Thank you, Marina Bay Sands, for making my son’s birthday a memory we will cherish forever.","a month ago on

The food was amazing as was the pool and all facilities. Nothing was too much trouble and I’m going to save to stay here for longer next time we visit Singapore."

fang li,2/5,"I had a very disappointing dining experience at the restaurant on the 55th floor of this supposedly “luxury” hotel.

I was invited to dinner by a friend who was staying in one of the VIP suites. The restaurant is not open to the public and is exclusively for hotel guests, which made the experience feel even more exclusive—until the service completely ruined it.

Shortly after we began our meal, a staff member informed us that the dining time was limited to 90 minutes. That seemed fine at first. However, well before the 90 minutes were up, we were rushed by the same staff to finish our meal. I politely asked if we could have a little more time, as we were still eating slowly, and I noticed that two other tables who arrived before us were still enjoying their meals as well.

Eventually, they agreed to extend our time by 30 minutes and sent another staff member to apologize. I then asked again, “Isn’t the restaurant open until a certain time? Can guests eat until closing?” The person who came to apologize said, “Yes, you can stay and dine until the end.” So why was I being pushed out before our time was even up?

What shocked me the most was the attitude of the first staff member—it felt cold and unwelcoming, as if we were not entitled to be there. Was it because we weren’t the registered guests, but just friends of a VIP guest? If so, that kind of discriminatory service is completely unacceptable in a hotel of this standard.

The environment and view were wonderful, but the service left a sour taste. Dining should be about hospitality and respect, and unfortunately, this experience had neither. I hope management takes this feedback seriously—this is not the level of service one expects a high-end establishment。","a month ago on

Staying at Marina Bay Sands was truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience that exceeded every expectation I had. From the moment I walked into the grand lobby, I could already feel that this was not just a hotel, but a world-class destination in itself. The scale, the design, and the atmosphere are breathtaking. Everything is built with such attention to detail that you immediately know you’re in one of the most iconic hotels in the world.

The highlight, of course, is the infinity pool at the SkyPark. I’ve seen it countless times in photos and videos, but being there in person is something else entirely. Swimming at the edge while overlooking the Singapore skyline is surreal—it feels like floating above the entire city. Day or night, the view is spectacular. In the morning, you get the calm and fresh energy of the city waking up, and at night, you’re treated to a dazzling skyline with lights that make the entire experience magical. It’s easily the most unforgettable pool I’ve ever been to.

The rooms are spacious, modern, and luxuriously comfortable. Floor-to-ceiling windows give you an unbeatable view, whether it’s the Gardens by the Bay or the city skyline. The beds are so comfortable that it’s almost difficult to get up in the morning—except you know you don’t want to waste any time staying in when you’re in such an amazing place. The bathroom amenities are top-notch, and everything feels meticulously maintained and spotless.

Dining at Marina Bay Sands is also an experience of its own. The selection of restaurants is phenomenal, from celebrity chef restaurants to local-inspired cuisine, ensuring there’s something for everyone. Every meal feels like part of the luxury experience, with flavors that are memorable and presentation that’s on point. The staff across all the restaurants are highly professional, attentive, and genuinely welcoming.

What makes Marina Bay Sands stand out even more is the service. Every staff member I interacted with—from reception, concierge, housekeeping, to the restaurants—was friendly, helpful, and professional. They really go the extra mile to make guests feel taken care of, which is the hallmark of true 5-star hospitality.

Beyond being a hotel, Marina Bay Sands is practically a city within a city. The integrated resort has luxury shopping, the ArtScience Museum, theaters, and direct access to Gardens by the Bay, making it incredibly convenient to explore. The location is unbeatable, with everything you need either within the resort or just a short walk away.

Overall, Marina Bay Sands is not just a hotel stay—it’s an experience. It’s luxurious, iconic, and unforgettable in every sense. Whether you’re traveling for leisure, business, or a special occasion, this place leaves a lasting impression that you’ll treasure for a lifetime. If you want to experience the best of Singapore, there’s no better place than Marina Bay Sands. Absolutely worth every dollar, and I can’t wait to come back again.","2 weeks ago on

Phuong Thu Vu,5/5,"A Review of the Sands Premier Suite at Marina Bay Sands
If you’re looking for a rejuvenating, luxurious holiday then you should definitely consider a stay at the prestigious Marina Bay Sands hotel!
Recently, me and my family had an amazing experience staying in the Sands Premier Suite of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. From the moment we arrived at the hotel, the staff were very helpful and polite. They immediately helped us with our luggages which made me felt very welcome.
The entire hotel, from the ceiling to the walls are designed with lots of thoughts in mind. Because we arrived way earlier than the check-in time, they arranged a temporary key so we could enjoy the infinity pool while waiting. From the infinity pool, you could see the whole skyline of Singapore. The water temperature is just cool enough to make you feel relaxed but warm enough so that you won’t have a hard time getting out.
After lunch, we came back to check-in and receive our room keys. They had 3 check-in counters, the “normal” one, the VIP one and the Paiza & Limosine one (which is like the Super VIP one). Because the “normal” check in counter was way too long, we got escorted to the Paiza & Limosine to check in. The receptionist there are very kind and quick, she got us our room in less than 5 minutes. Even though I booked the Sands Premier Studio, we got upgraded to the Sands Premier Suite (for free!).
The room was much bigger than a standard hotel room, with a separate living area that had a comfortable sofa and a large TV. The bedroom was also spacious and the bed was one of the most comfortable I’ve ever slept in. I really liked the floor-to-ceiling windows, which offered a stunning view of either the city skyline or the Gardens by the Bay. I chose the city view, and it was breathtaking, especially at night.
The bathroom was very modern and felt like a spa. It had a big bathtub for two people, which was a nice touch. They also provided very nice toiletries from Jo Malone. The room also had a walk-in wardrobe, which was very useful for keeping the room tidy and getting ready.
In conclusion, I would highly recommend the Sands Premier Suite. It’s a very luxurious option that offers excellent comfort, great amenities, and beautiful views. While it is quite expensive, the experience is worth it if you are looking for a special treat.","a week ago on

Shane McLean,5/5,"Marina Bay Sands is, without a doubt, one of the most spectacular hotel experiences I’ve ever had. From the moment you walk into the grand lobby, you’re immersed in luxury, elegance, and impeccable service.

The infinity pool on the 57th floor is every bit as iconic as it looks in the photos—floating above the city skyline, it offers jaw-dropping panoramic views of Singapore. Watching the sunrise from the pool with a coffee in hand was pure magic.

My room was spacious, sleek, and sophisticated, with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking either the bay or the city. Every detail felt premium—from the plush bedding to the advanced tech and luxurious bathroom amenities.

Dining at Marina Bay Sands is a culinary journey. I had the pleasure of enjoying a world-class dinner at one of the celebrity chef restaurants and also loved the more casual options throughout the property. The buffet breakfast alone is worth writing home about—an incredible spread that caters to every taste.

The hotel is also in the perfect location—connected to high-end shops, the ArtScience Museum, and just steps from Gardens by the Bay. Whether you want to shop, sightsee, or just unwind in style, everything you need is right there.

It’s definitely a luxury stay with a luxury price tag, but in my opinion, it’s absolutely worth it for the once-in-a-lifetime experience. Marina Bay Sands isn’t just a hotel—it’s a destination.","4 months ago on

Deshani Bandara,5/5,"Marina Bay Sands Mall is truly a world-class shopping experience. From the moment you step in, the architecture grabs your attention  tall glass ceilings, polished marble floors, and a layout that blends elegance with ease. It feels more like walking through a luxury art gallery than a mall.

The range of shops is impressive from global designer labels like Louis Vuitton and Gucci to fine watch boutiques,handbags and jewelry stores. If you want to treat your self with luxury brands ,this is the place.

One of the best parts for me was the canal inside the mall, where you can take a gondola ride a lovely touch if you want something different. The waterfall feature in the middle adds to the charm.

The food options are diverse: from high end restaurants to casual bites and a food court downstairs with local and international cuisines.

The location is ideal too connected to Marina Bay Sands hotel, ArtScience Museum, and just a walk away from the Gardens by the Bay and the Spectra Light Show.","a month ago on

Michael Mayer,5/5,"This hotel is perfect. Check in couldn’t have been more helpful. We were given and upgrade as it was my birthday along and as we were just staying one night and had a late flight the next day we were offered a replacement keycard for the next day to access the facilities as well as a bookable shower room so we could freshen up before heading to the airport.

The room was not huge but was so comfortable and well appointed. The bathroom was gorgeous and everything felt fresh and brand new. The tech worked well including wireless charging on the night stands, auto opening curtains and the largest tv I have ever seen in a hotel room.

We had a great view of the city but immediately changed to try out the infinity pool which is better than I could have ever imagined. The staff are kind but some of the servers could do with a little more training as quite a few mistakes were made. Food and drinks came from nearby Wolfgang Puck Spago and even simple things such as a Caesar salad or burger were really excellent.

It is open 6am until midnight and we went three times to visit. Don’t forget the hot tubs on the other side of the pool deck.

The hotel itself is absolutely huge and has a large number of restaurants within it, also a massive shopping mall, nightclub and casino. It is a city within a city.

It is also close to Gardens on the Bay and a walkway goes through the hotel towards it. But you can’t access the walkway from the hotel and have to exit the hotel and take a small lift and then walk back into the hotel at walkway level. A small detail.

The location is not great for the city but there is a metro stop nearby and of course it is perfect for all the attractions around the Marina Bay. One day was not enough. I can’t wait to go back.","2 months ago on

The room was not huge but was so comfortable and well appointed. The bathroom was gorgeous and everything felt fresh and brand new. The tech worked well including wireless charging on the night stands, auto opening curtains and the largest tv I have ever seen in a hotel room.

We had a great view of the city but immediately changed to try out the infinity pool which is better than I could have ever imagined. The staff are kind but some of the servers could do with a little more training as quite a few mistakes were made. Food and drinks came from nearby Wolfgang Puck Spago and even simple things such as a Caesar salad or burger were really excellent.

It is open 6am until midnight and we went three times to visit. Don’t forget the hot tubs on the other side of the pool deck.

The hotel itself is absolutely huge and has a large number of restaurants within it, also a massive shopping mall, nightclub and casino. It is a city within a city.

It is also close to Gardens on the Bay and a walkway goes through the hotel towards it. But you can’t access the walkway from the hotel and have to exit the hotel and take a small lift and then walk back into the hotel at walkway level. A small detail.

The location is not great for the city but there is a metro stop nearby and of course it is perfect for all the attractions around the Marina Bay. One day was not enough. I can’t wait to go back."
Eugenie,2/5,"Went to access this hotel while on my recent Singapore stay.
I didn't stay at the hotel, so am not offering a critique of the rooms/suites.
At 11.45-12pm, the lobby/foyer was insanely busy, there were hundreds of people checking in/out or hanging around.  Only black taxis( the expensive ones) were around and the valet and doormen were over whelmed. When I was leaving the cost for the black taxi to go to the airport was insane.
Overall, the crowd put me off immediately to even consider staying at this hotel.
There are so many instructions on how to get around the hotel, and which lifts to use.
I chose to have lunch at the foyer restaurant, as it's seafood buffet had been suggested to me. The restaurant is nice and the staff wonderful. The selection in the multi cuisine buffet stations is excellent, unfortunately with the exception of the seafood station. Prawns, lobster, crayfish, scallops arrive frozen from origin, then thawed and place on ice. All these were soggy, tasteless and chewy. I would avoid these.
The Sushi/Sashimi station is excellent.
The food in rest of the stations was also excellent.
I visited the pool, which was again very crowded. I don't care how good a view a pool has, the crowd here was intolerable.
The top level restaurants and bars have a lovely view, so lunch or dinner would be a nice experience.","2 months ago on

Wayne w,5/5,"An absolute pleasure to stay here for a few nights.  It is expensive, but for a treat I think it is well worth it.  My only complaint is that when asking them to arrange a taxi, they will book an unmetered taxi for you which is far more expensive than a metered taxi, so rather book your own metered taxi than use their more expensive option.  Everything else is above and beyond expectations.","2 months ago on

DR KESAVAN DHANAPAL,4/5,"Our visit to Marina Bay Sands was a memorable one, especially the experience of going to the top and witnessing the spectacular views of Singapore’s skyline. The coordination by the staff was commendable. Although we initially faced a small issue with our ticket not scanning properly, the team handled it with genuine warmth and professionalism. They reassured us not to worry, quickly sorted out the problem, and welcomed us with a friendly smile, which really set the tone for a great experience.

Once we reached the top, the view was undeniably impressive—stretching across iconic landmarks like the Singapore Flyer, Gardens by the Bay, and the endless expanse of city and sea. Everything was immaculately maintained, from the observation deck to the common areas. Cleanliness and upkeep clearly seem to be a top priority here.

That said, there are a few areas where the experience could be elevated further. Tourists today look for more interactive and immersive elements. Simple additions—like informative or engaging video displays inside the lifts (similar to what Burj Khalifa offers)—can really enhance the journey upward. Even having touch-screen installations at the top showcasing the history or stories of the buildings in view could add value.

Also, visiting during the daytime can be quite uncomfortable due to the harsh sun and heat. Some shaded or misted zones, or even cooling stations, would allow visitors to enjoy their time without feeling the need to rush through it.

Overall, Marina Bay Sands offers an iconic view, with a great team on the ground—but with just a few tweaks, it could offer a more memorable and comfortable experience for all.","a month ago on

Francesco,3/5,"The design and architecture of Marina Bay Danza are truly impressive – the property is visually stunning and very well thought out in terms of style. Unfortunately, the overall experience does not match the beauty of the place.

Service is consistently poor, with little attention to guest needs and very limited customer care. The room amenities are disappointing for a property of this level, making the stay far less comfortable than expected.

The pool area looks beautiful at first glance, but quickly becomes a letdown. There are no sunshades provided, the sunbeds are placed extremely close to each other with no sense of privacy, and once again the service around the pool is lacking.

In short, while Marina Bay Danza scores highly for design and atmosphere, it falls short in almost every other aspect that makes a stay in a 5 star hotel.","a month ago on

Phineas Flynn,5/5,"Marina Bay Sands is without a doubt one of the most iconic landmarks in Singapore, offering a luxurious experience from start to finish. The architecture alone is breathtaking—three towers connected by the famous SkyPark, which offers stunning panoramic views of the city skyline, Marina Bay, and beyond.

The Infinity Pool on the rooftop is world-famous and truly lives up to the hype. It’s only accessible to hotel guests, but if you get the chance to stay, it’s worth it for that view alone. There’s also a public observation deck if you're not staying at the hotel.

Inside, MBS features a high-end shopping mall with luxury brands, a canal with gondola rides, and a wide variety of restaurants—from celebrity chef fine dining to local delicacies. The ArtScience Museum and nightly Spectra light and water show at the promenade are great additions that make it a complete entertainment destination.

It’s directly connected to Gardens by the Bay via a beautiful pedestrian bridge, and the Bayfront MRT station is just below the complex, making it super accessible.

Md. Raisul Islam,4/5,"Marina Bay Sands in Singapore is a landmark that has become synonymous with luxury and innovation since its opening in 2011. Located on the waterfront of Marina Bay, the resort features an iconic design with three interconnected towers, topped by the Sands SkyPark, which boasts the world’s largest infinity pool. This rooftop area offers stunning panoramic views of Singapore’s skyline, creating a unique experience for hotel guests.

The resort offers 1,850 rooms and suites, ranging from elegant Premier Rooms to the ultra-luxurious Paiza Collection. The rooms are designed with modern sophistication, featuring plush furnishings, marble bathrooms, and the latest in-room technology. Guests staying in the Paiza Collection enjoy exclusive benefits, including butler service, private lounge access, and enhanced privileges at the SkyPark.

Marina Bay Sands is also home to an impressive selection of dining options, with over 80 restaurants and bars. Renowned chefs like Wolfgang Puck, Gordon Ramsay, and Tetsuya Wakuda have established eateries here, offering a variety of world-class culinary experiences. The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands, an upscale shopping mall, features more than 300 luxury stores, while the ArtScience Museum offers an intriguing mix of exhibitions that combine art, science, and technology.

Entertainment options at the resort are abundant. The light and water show, Spectra, is a nightly spectacle, and the MARQUEE nightclub adds to the vibrant nightlife scene. The casino, along with a theater hosting international performances and a large convention center, ensures that there’s always something to do. For those looking for relaxation, the Banyan Tree Spa provides a range of luxurious treatments, and the fitness center is equipped with state-of-the-art facilities.

One downside to consider is the resort’s sheer size, which can lead to crowded public areas, especially during peak seasons. Guests have occasionally mentioned longer wait times for certain amenities. Despite this, the vast array of services and the exceptional level of service offered at Marina Bay Sands often outweigh these inconveniences.

Marina Bay Sands is a top-tier destination for travelers seeking a luxurious all-in-one resort experience. Whether you’re enjoying the infinity pool, dining at world-class restaurants, shopping, or indulging in the entertainment, the resort offers something for everyone, making it a standout choice when visiting Singapore.","3 weeks ago on

Dave,3/5,"Outside of the casino is great, but if you want to gamble (and drink alcohol) I would recommend the short mrt/monorail ride to Resorts world casino.
For some reason they make it very difficult to obtain a beer (served in a warm plastic mug, no open bar so you need to find a service person) and they will tell you about a Singaporean law saying you need to wait 30mins at least before you order another. This law I did not see anywhere else in Singapore so the slow service does seem on purpose. Very crowded too.","3 months ago on

Mario Botakis,4/5,"Excellent location, best part personally was the shower head, I know weird but true, followed by the view from the room. Rooftop pool is amazing, can get very windy up there, worst part might be the check in reception area, it's not formal at all and seriously for the money you'd think they would provide a private reception instead of a chaotic environment because of foot traffic. Shopping and food are top notch, gardens by the bay and supertrees very close by. Definitely recommend the hotel as it was an overall a great experience.","6 months ago on

shahzain mustafa,5/5,"Marina Bay Sands isn’t just a hotel—it's an icon that defines the Singapore skyline and an immersive experience in luxury, architecture, and entertainment. From the moment you enter, you're surrounded by a sense of scale and grandeur that few hotels in the world can match. The triple-tower structure, connected at the top by the SkyPark, feels futuristic yet harmoniously integrated with the Marina Bay waterfront.

I stayed in a Premier Room on a high floor, and the view from the floor-to-ceiling windows was absolutely unforgettable—overlooking Gardens by the Bay and the Singapore Strait. The room itself was luxurious yet understated, with thoughtful design touches, a spacious bathroom with a rain shower, and everything you’d expect from a world-class 5-star property.

Of course, the highlight was the infinity pool. It's reserved for hotel guests only and lives up to every bit of hype. Watching the city skyline glow at dusk while swimming 57 stories up was something I’ll remember forever. The SkyPark observation deck, accessible to the public for a fee, is also fantastic for views and photos.

Dining was equally stellar—LAVO had one of the best Italian meals I’ve had in Asia, and breakfast at Rise was generous, varied, and well-executed. The integrated shopping mall downstairs (The Shoppes) has everything from Louis Vuitton to artisanal coffee shops. You’ll also find the ArtScience Museum here, with its lotus-like design and rotating exhibitions.

Yes, it’s expensive. But for what you’re getting—the architecture, the views, the facilities, the sheer wow-factor—it’s one of those places worth splurging on at least once. Tip: Book early and request a higher floor with a pool-facing view","2 months ago on

We got there, told we needed to book, they were full and couldn't fit us in.
There was some tension for 5 or so mins while my brother explained what we were told by customer service. Anyway they were going to get us a table. A minimum of $30 a head spend. Cheapest cocktail $20 and cheapest dish $20.
The customer service team had incorrect information but this is a very fancy hotel.
Also, everyone including people staying were rude and snobby.

Julie Kay Hoyle,4/5,"It was a surreal experience, which was good. It is expensive to dine within the hotel at various venues. Drinks were very expensive too. A buffet breakfast was included, but oh my goodness, it was extremely busy no matter what time we attended. One day, there were over 70 people in the queue waiting to be seated. We sent an email to the hotel, as one day, our allocated table was next to a door for anyone to go outside into the garden dining area. This particular breakfast wasn't enjoyable as it was a constant thoroughfare with so many other guests squeezing past. We received a phone call within a few minutes of sending our email. They understood our issue but didn't offer any solution. We weren't offered this table again 🙏 The said table was still in place the following day! We also sadly noticed the huge amount of food being wasted from a lot of guests.
We had a couple of issues having to wait, one was for some wine we had ordered for our room, we eventually after almost an hour of waiting received a call to advise the wine wasn't available!
The room itself was lovely & the views were beautiful. Overall the staff were extremely polite & very helpful.
The main thoroughfare near to reception is extremely busy, with anyone being able to access not just guests staying at the hotel as the shopping mall/cinema/casino/restaurants, etc, are accessible from here.
We do hope the infrastructure is being carefully considered whilst Tower 4 is being constructed, as the number of people moving through & around is extremely busy!!
The infinity pool was amazing though & enjoyable 😎","6 months ago on

Paul Allen,5/5,"When visiting your amazing property recently, my wife unfortunately left her phone in a taxi, which she realised after she departed the taxi.
We immediately liased with your Concierge staff who immediately got security involved and were able to quickly ascertain the taxi company and driver and make contact with them. The phone was promptly returned adding to our positive experience at your property.
Tinakaren # 842099 was absolutely exceptional with his service and patience, making several calls to track down the phone whilst consistently talking us through the process whilst also liasing with his security staff, the man is a multi tasking guru.
Tinakaren #842099 professionalism, kindness, and understanding went far beyond what anyone could expect. The fact that we weren’t even staying at Marina Sands makes his efforts even more remarkable. He is a true credit to the hotel and a shining example of outstanding service.

We visited three times, to the hotel and lobby bar. To tower three for a fine dining experience at Spago on L57 and to the shoppes for casual dining, shopping and the Sampan boat ride which is a must do.

Pro tip, book in advance at a restaurant or bar on L57 so you can enjoy the million dollar views, along with the establishments observation deck (which is) often private and for patrons only.

Skypark observatory seems to have massive queues (and) for slightly more than you’d pay for the fee (you) can enjoy a beautiful experience instead.","7 months ago on

Joel Hames,5/5,"We had only one night at MBS, and it wasn’t enough. First, Singapore has too much to offer to try and fit in to a short layover. Second, this hotel is a great place to use as a base, conveniently located and with a ton of stuff to do on-site.

It isn’t the most “bespoke” hotel. You’ll find friendly staff (we had an absolutely lovely woman checking us in!), and a ton of conveniences. What you won’t find is the hyper personal touch that a small, boutique hotel might offer. That said, you probably know that already considering the size and scope of this hotel.

Perhaps, and as no surprise, the highlight is the Infinity Pool at the top. We went up in the morning, on a day with rain and clouds. We still enjoyed it. Though it was a bit cold for our comfort, we jumped between the infinity pool and a nearby jacuzzi. It was a fun and memorable experience.

Shopping nearby is plentiful, and the food options are many. We would love to stay longer the next time we visit.","2 years ago on

Nothing special in terms of service or anything exceptional that makes it stand out other than the building.

Adventure Factory,5/5,"This is one of the best hotels in Singapore located right in the middle of the action area. Everything is just a stone's throw away. There are a lot of shopping options if you are into indulgence. You can also explore nearby options quickly if you are staying here.

It has one of the best infinity pools which is located on the 57th floor and only accessible to hotel guests. The only issue is it would be crowded mostly and You can see a lot of guests clicking pictures and capturing the skyline. It gives one of the best views of the city and they have restaurants like Spago and Lavo right next to the pool which give quite a few and reasonable eating options as compared to the charges of the room.

Overall I would say that the room sizes could be better at the cost that is charged but then again you should be prepared for spending some money if you want to visit and stay in one of the most expensive hotels in one of the most expensive city 😜. Definitely a must go if you have the money to experience.","a year ago on

Blaine Burnett,3/5,Honestly I expected much more. It's a relatively nice hotel but that's about it. The service was good but not great. The room seemed to rely on the spectacular view as a selling point but the furnishings were cheap looking and in some places damaged. Room amenities vere very basic. The in room dining was a little disappointing. It kind of reminds me of a Disney resort hotel without the characters or excellent service. The restaurant we tried inside the hotel wasn't great although the views again were spectacular. Fortunately you have direct access to the shops in the mall and some really great places to eat. There are also loads of high end stores so if shopping is your thing that will definitely help. The infinity pool/sky-park were very nice but definitely not worth staying there for. The complex is connected to Gardens by the Bay which is an awesome attraction. The garden is accessible from many downtown hotels though so again not sure it's worth staying here for. One tip for this place is that it is HUGE. Give yourself some extra time if you are going anywhere that is not in the tower you are staying in. We had a nice stay but the hotel itself was just average.,"5 years ago on

Dharshan Bapu,5/5,"This is a stunning hotel and will be landmark of Singapore for years to come. If you can afford to stay it’s a great one I believe, I couldn’t afford so we went in for the deck tour to get the superior view of Singapore from top. Guess it was more than 54 floor and deck is on top floor and went in by a high speed elevator, was not crowded when we went, the cost covers a digital photo and if you need a printed one it’s extra. The view from the deck is stunning and luckily when we went it was not that sunny, so could enjoy the view. The swimming pool is on other side and only residents are allowed and from the deck we can catch a glimpse. Please experience this view if you are in Singapore. Once we were done and got to the reception level we strolled the huge lobby which was decorated well for Christmas and had some snacks at the cafe /bakery there. Taste was awesome and you must try. From the entrance of the hotel where taxi dropped us for the deck tour the gardens by the bay is walkable which is another attraction you should not miss.","2 years ago on

Our room was exceptional; clean, well appointed, nicely furnished (it had two TVs!) and the view was incredible. Pay the extra for a high floor and marina bay view, you won’t be disappointed. Guests have exclusive access to the infinity pool on level 57. It does get busy, especially in the afternoon, but it is open from 6am to 11pm so there are quieter times to visit. NB the pool is not heated and can be chilly!  The pool bartenders are so nice and attentive. I would’ve relaxed here all day but the amazing views of Singapore beckon you.
The concierge team also deserve a mention. Welcoming, informative and really helpful about the hotel and Singapore in general. Ask them anything, they have the answer!

Wii L,5/5,"Good rooms if you don't stay at the most basic rooms. Always get an upgrade or pay for one - it's worth it. Since there are a lot of rooms, expect room service to take a while. The suites are magnificent, of course. Lounge serves a good variety of food and drinks (alcohol included) so if you've got access, don't bother getting dinner elsewhere.","3 years ago on

The shampoo, conditioner and lotion smelled really nice. They give you a bathrobe and slippers too which was convenient. Everything is very accessible since you’re right in the middle of town. There’s even a MRT station on the bottom floor. I don’t have any complaints! Oh and the pool is so nice! I could’ve laid there all day. You’re definitely paying for it though!","2 years ago on

A Chan,5/5,"This was one of the most unique hotel experiences, the pool was fantastic. The roof top breakfast at Spago was excellent and the breeze coming in was cooling which is surprising given it's Singapore!

Minor area for improvement: The check in process left much to be desired as the app to check-in that was meant to streamline the check in process ended up being extremely inefficient.

Other than that, the views from the room were fantastic, we were on the 34th floor. We were able to watch the sunrise from the comfort of our room.","2 years ago on

Getting in and out of the casino can be a bit odd but it's due to the cost for locals vs free for tourists. The mall is high end, and the resteraunts are delicious.

S J,4/5,"Marina Bay Sands is truly a symbol of Singapore, and it’s a place I visit every year.

With so many rooms and guests, compared to other hotels of the same class, it doesn’t give the feeling of personalized care while moving around the hotel. However, the service at the lobby and concierge is excellent.

A few years ago, the hotel underwent a major renovation, and the rooms have been updated to a higher standard, which I’m really happy with. Since COVID, hotel prices in Singapore have risen across the board, and Marina Bay Sands is no exception. It’s now hard to find a room for under $700 a night.

Still, the signature infinity pool is something you just can’t miss :) I often bring guests here, and the growing number of F&B outlets offers a variety of options, which is very satisfying.","3 weeks ago on

G,1/5,"We were so excited to be staying at the Sand’s as we had heard so many good things about it.

We arrived at the hotel and went to check in. Maybe 3 reception stations were open with about 2-3 employees at each one. It felt like an airport check in.

After standing in line for around 10minutes we were told to go to a back room to check in. The lady who checked us in was incredibly unfriendly. If she smiled it would have cracked her face.

Room was very nice but small. View was great until you looked down to the ground and they were doing construction. They don’t tell you this when you check in to a room with the garden view.

We were told our bags would arrive within 15-20min after checking in. After 30min I called front desk and I was told they were on the way up. 30min after that call luggage never arrived. I then called again and told them I was coming down to reception to collect the bags.

They once again told me the bags are on the way up. 10min later the bags arrived.

We headed up to the observation deck and it was like stepping foot into a disaster camp. As soon as you exit the elevator staff with cameras try and con you to take photos for money. This was really irritating and they blocked the entire walk way to the outer deck.

You had people sleeping all over the chairs and deck floor. There was even people having picnics with food out on the deck. So tacky.

Went and asked for information at the desk and again a stone cold faced women barely spoke to us.

For the price they charge and the service they provide it is not worth it. Staff are rude and the place is like an airport terminal.","2 weeks ago on

The infinity pool on the roof was packed and dirty. The service was exceptional though but unfortunately it did not make up for the hotels shortcomings.

Marina Bay is unquestionably the hub of modern Singapore, featuring a stunning skyline that is especially dazzling at night when the city lights majestically reflect off the bay. The area is meticulously managed, ensuring flawless cleanliness, safety, and organization, rendering it perfect for leisurely strolls or romantic evenings. Notable attractions include the Marina Bay Sands SkyPark, which offers panoramic views, the Spectra Light & Water Show, and the Gardens by the Bay, particularly the Supertree Grove. The surrounding area also boasts outstanding dining options, ranging from street food to fine dining with remarkable views.

Eitan Elul,5/5,"Marina Bay Sands is one of those places you have to experience at least once in Singapore — it’s more than just a hotel, it’s an icon. The views from the rooftop are legendary, but here’s the insider tip: instead of paying for a full-day pass, make a reservation at one of the rooftop bars or restaurants. That way, you get the same incredible skyline without overspending. Sometimes staff will let you walk around after dining, but it’s not guaranteed — so booking a drink or meal is the safest bet.

The food here is truly exceptional. From high-end restaurants to casual bites, everything feels curated, and you don’t have to break the bank if you plan wisely. Downstairs, the Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands mall is stunning — a mix of luxury brands, unique boutiques, and even a canal with gondola rides. Don’t miss the wine and whisky collection store; it’s like walking into a museum of rare bottles.

At night, the free Spectra light and water show at 8:00 and 9:00 PM outside the mall is a must-see — a dazzling blend of fountains, lasers, and music against the backdrop of the bay. Inside the hotel, the architecture itself is an experience: the world’s largest rooftop infinity pool (hotel guests only), soaring lobbies, and restaurants that rival any luxury destination.

Fun facts:
• Marina Bay Sands opened in 2010 and cost around $5.5 billion USD to build.
• The rooftop SkyPark spans all three towers and could fit four and a half A380 planes end to end.
• The infinity pool is the longest elevated pool in the world at 150m.

Tip: Book a restaurant in advance for sunset, explore the mall before or after, and stay for the evening light show. It’s one of the few luxury experiences where you control how much you spend — and it’s worth every minute.","3 weeks ago on

Downstairs, the Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands mall is stunning — a mix of luxury brands, unique boutiques, and even a canal with gondola rides. Don’t miss the wine and whisky collection store; it’s like walking into a museum of rare bottles.

At night, the free Spectra light and water show at 8:00 and 9:00 PM outside the mall is a must-see — a dazzling blend of fountains, lasers, and music against the backdrop of the bay. Inside the hotel, the architecture itself is an experience: the world’s largest rooftop infinity pool (hotel guests only), soaring lobbies, and restaurants that rival any luxury destination.

Fun facts:
• Marina Bay Sands opened in 2010 and cost around $5.5 billion USD to build.
• The rooftop SkyPark spans all three towers and could fit four and a half A380 planes end to end.
• The infinity pool is the longest elevated pool in the world at 150m.

Tip: Book a restaurant in advance for sunset, explore the mall before or after, and stay for the evening light show. It’s one of the few luxury experiences where you control how much you spend — and it’s worth every minute."
Simon Liang,5/5,"This was the highlight of my Singapore trip in early 2024.
Marina Bay Sands truly earns every single star of its 5 star rating.
The rooms are spacious, spotless & the main lobby is huge.
The service is top notch. We only stayed there for 1 night as it's quite expensive & I'm usually quite a budget conscious person, so I don't usually stay at 5 star hotels, but the MBS hotel service is second to none. After getting there, we were immediately offered assistance with our luggage by staff, which was brought upstairs for us. The check in & check out process is seamless & straight-forward.
I'm not a gambler, so I didn't go to the casino, but I do like to keep my fitness up whilst I'm away, so I do recommend their gym. It is a fair walk from the rooms, but the variety of equipment was fantastic & it's a 24 hour gym too.
Obviously, you also can't go past the Infinity Pool whilst you're at MBS. Just remember to take your hotel key card with you when you go up.
Overall, despite the high price tag, I do recommend MBS if you do stay in Singapore, even if it's just for 1 night.","a month ago on

Ain Zin,5/5,"Booked a staycation for my parents birthdays and anniversary this August. We were warmly greeted by the hotel staffs upon arrival, and a heartfelt compliment goes to Tiffany Tan who was the concierge staff that attended to us and settled our check-in. We were pleasantly surprised when Tiffany had offered a room upgrade to celebrate the occasion if we don’t mind waiting a bit longer to get the room ready. Whilst waiting she offered temporary guest cards so they have access to the observation deck and pool which was much nicer than waiting at the lobby. On top of that, we also found a delicious chocolate cake in the room! My parents were beyond delighted by this sweet gesture, and I can’t thank Tiffany enough for being so attentive in making this absolutely memorable for them. The room was of course immaculate, the view stunning and the experience exceeded expectations. They enjoyed their stay and will definitely be back! Thank you once again to the amazing team at MBS.","3 weeks ago on

Tai Chen,5/5,"A seaside hotel that captures the imagination often blends natural beauty with human-centric design, creating an immersive escape from the mundane. Here’s a multidimensional portrayal of an ideal coastal retreat:

**1. Symbiosis with the Ocean**
- **Boundless Vistas**: Perched atop a crescent-shaped bay, every suite features 270-degree floor-to-ceiling windows. The tides become a living mural, while the ""Golden Hour of the Sea"" during dawn and dusk offers a private visual feast.
- **Exclusive Shoreline**: A private 800-meter white sand beach pairs with a tidal monitoring system that alerts guests to optimal tide-pooling times. Guided explorations reveal hidden intertidal ecosystems at low tide.

**2. Architectural Poetry**
- **Cultural Reverence**: Inspired by traditional fishing village dwellings, the terraced structure boasts a façade embedded with millions of recycled seashells, their undulating textures shimmering like sunlit waves.
- **Liquid Aesthetics**: The lobby dazzles with 3,000 hand-blown glass jellyfish lamps. Ocean breezes animate the space, casting rippling shadows that transform check-in into an aquatic overture.

**3. Sensory Sanctuary**
- **Smart Ambiance**: Beds auto-adjust to body contours, while voice-controlled systems cycle through soundscapes like ""coral reef white noise"" or ""dolphin frequency."" Mineral-seaweed aromas diffuse via circadian-rhythm scent systems.
- **Marine Interaction**: Balconies house underwater periscopes; UV night mode unveils bioluminescent plankton. A cabin journal logs daily sightings of rare marine species.

**4. Reimagined Ocean Experiences**
- **Tidal Gastronomy**: A 18-course ""Marine Evolution"" tasting menu evolves with daily catches. Glass-floored dining platforms frame schools of fish darting beneath diners’ feet.
- **Abyssal Meditation**: Collaborating with oceanographers, transparent submersible pods host singing bowl sessions at 20-meter depths, where humpback whale songs resonate through the hull.

**5. Sustainable Innovation**
- Tidal energy meets 60% of power needs; greywater nourishes vertical algae walls that filter CO₂.
- The ""Coral Adoption Program"" lets guests plant reefs for carbon credits, redeemable for eco-experiences like nocturnal squid tagging.

More than a hotel, it’s a portal to marine consciousness—when bare feet touch moon-warmed sands and smart tidal bracelets pulse to signal a bioluminescent bloom, worldly identities dissolve with the receding tide, leaving only the true self in whispered dialogue with the eternal sea.","Edited 5 months ago on

Benedict Correya,5/5,"An iconic landmark of Singapore and a must-visit destination. The architecture itself is breathtaking, and the views from the SkyPark Observation Deck are absolutely stunning—especially at sunset when the city skyline lights up. The infinity pool at the top is world-famous, and for good reason, offering one of the most unique swimming experiences in the world.

Inside, Marina Bay Sands offers everything under one roof: a luxury shopping mall with high-end brands, a wide range of restaurants (from celebrity chefs to casual dining), a casino, and even a museum. The Spectra light and water show at night by the bay is a highlight not to be missed—free and beautifully choreographed.

While it is on the pricier side, the experience is unmatched and worth it at least once. A true symbol of modern Singapore.","Edited a month ago on

We started by strolling through the luxurious mall, where they enjoyed browsing the wide range of shops. The atmosphere was vibrant, and the architecture itself was impressive, adding to the overall experience.

After exploring the mall, we took a leisurely walk through the surrounding areas, which offered stunning views of the city skyline. The walk across to Gardens by the Bay was particularly enjoyable, as it provided a perfect blend of modernity and nature. Our friends were captivated by the seamless transition from the bustling mall to the serene gardens.

This was my second stay at Marina Bay Sands, and it’s now my absolute favorite! I opted for a suite room overlooking the breathtaking Gardens by the Bay, and it truly took my experience to the next level. The suite itself was exquisitely detailed, every inch of the room designed to perfection. From the plush bedding to the sleek bathroom and high-end amenities, the attention to quality was second to none.

The views were beyond spectacular, and it felt like the gardens were an extension of the suite, creating a serene and unforgettable atmosphere. But what truly made my stay exceptional was the staff. They were incredibly attentive, friendly, and went above and beyond to make sure my stay was perfect. Nothing was too much for them—each request was met with a genuine smile and impeccable service.

Overall, Marina Bay Sands is the ultimate hotel experience. It’s a place that leaves you inspired and looking forward to returning. If you’re looking for an unforgettable, luxurious getaway, this is where you need to be!","10 months ago on

Freddie Brown,5/5,"We visited to the observation deck at 1945. Very busy with people heading up for the light shows from above. I would say that the light show facing the park side is worth it from the top but not for the marina light show. That one is better watched down on the between between Apple and LV.
I would recommend going up at night though as once the light show finishes, it does thin out and it was a pleasurable experience.","9 months ago on

John Byrne,5/5,What can I say other than it’s an amazing hotel. We got upgraded to a suite with a garden and city view which was amazing. Staff are brilliant very helpful and everything done with a smile. Rooftop bar and pool are a must see. Being in an infinity pool 57 floors up was breathtaking. Really enjoyed the whole experience. The Cé La Vi bar is always buzzing with fantastic views. Hotel also has a mall with all the top luxury brands. Cant wait to go back.,"a year ago on

Ben Old,5/5,"It’s new and shiny and Singapores version of Vegas. Ultra flashy retail (anyone need to pick up a Patek Philippe before dinner?), fancy dinning options etc, but decidedly Singapore. So more hushed tones, politeness and order than the average casino resort.

Roof top pool is actually epic, and staff super friendly and attentive. Looks as good as the pictures.

Room was very nice, well sized, all the tech and a TV as big as a house. We had a balcony with a view of the gardens and would say that is a great option.","10 months ago on

D S,3/5,"There for NYE celebrations 🍾.   Amazing experience.

Only issue was the mass confusion of how to exit the venue after the fireworks. Entries and exits were locked and couldn't find a way out to the street.  0,000s of people were cramming to enter the MTR.

Fluked finding the underground carpark, still not knowing how to exit the venue.  If not for a generous local, who had parked there, offering to drive me home, I'd probably be stuck there for hours!! With all the locked entries/exits that night, I'm concerned as to how they would have evacuated visitors had there been a fire.","Edited 7 months ago on

You can choose to sit on the pool view side or sea view. I get that the best places need to be reserved for guests that's right... But it would have been nice to step out to take a better photo of the views.

It as lovely to see the decorations for Xmas.

The cocktails and mocktails were fairly expensive, but tasted fantastic. Shame that there were no alcohol free gins available as mocktails with these taste good and are popular.

Staff were helpful and friendly. One troll loads of photos for our group to make sure we got the perfect shot.

Desserts were fabulous. Especially the kulfi in 2 flavours.","10 months ago on

Eduard Matúš,5/5,"We stayed in Marina Bay Sands to celebrate our anniversary. The hotel staff was amazing and they went beyond our expectations to make our experience a very special one 🙏

The room was both beautiful and highly functional in ways that actually matter: High-end Audio, automated lights, curtains, HVAC all controllable from the TV.

Our stay in MBS by itself made the trip to Singapore totally worth it.

The location is perfect, views amazing and there's top notch shopping, dining and entertainment in the same building.

If there is one nit that I think can be improved on:
It would be amazing to offer a wider food menu for room service, or to offer in-room dining experiences from some of the high end restaurants in the MBS complex. Allowing guests to enjoy top notch dining in a top-notch room with top-notch views.

And I didn't even get to the insane infinity pool on top of the building 🙂

If you're thinking of booking one night, strongly consider booking two to have one full day without worrying about logistics.","10 months ago on

It is like a high quality Hawker Center or something.  Plus, there is a Subway that goes right through the middle of it.  The Downtown line comes directly to this mall! Plus, in case you didn't know this already, you can actually walk on top of this mall!  There is an elevator to the top, and the view from here is amazing!  Not only that, but you can also walk directly to the Supertree Forest, via a special walkway which they have built between the two locations, saving you all kinds of time.  There is a lotus lake outside which almost nobody visits, which is a great place to enjoy some Tea or Coffee.  There is a casino here, and a lot more.

Towers are immaculate to walk through, the adjacent mall has one or more stores of almost all important designers. We only noticed Zimmermann who wasn't present.
Make sure to get their member card, if you plan on buying anything or eat at black tap burgers for example.

Their staff was extremely friendly, they even lined up our shoes and folded clothes that we threw on the couch. After using most of our complementary coffee capsules, they even gave us one more of each and plenty of sweets. Minibar is well stocked with a good variety of snacks, softdrinks and even a shaker to make your own cocktails. Even the size of the coffee was adjusted to match their cups.
Rooms are clean and of high quality interior. You can control all lighting, do not disturb and Ac from each side of your bed, which was a nice add on. When we left they put a number of glass cleaning clothes and even a cable organizer + amenities to take with us.

Probably the best city hotel I have ever stayed at. Definitely worth the money, don't look any further.

Kishore DK,5/5,"Marina Bay Sands in Singapore is an iconic luxury destination that offers a unique combination of world-class hospitality, stunning architecture, and exceptional experiences. Located in the heart of the city, it is renowned for its striking design, featuring three interconnected towers topped by the SkyPark, which provides panoramic views of the Singapore skyline.

The hotel boasts opulent rooms and suites with modern amenities, elegant furnishings, and floor-to-ceiling windows that showcase breathtaking city or sea views. The service is exemplary, with staff going above and beyond to ensure a seamless stay.

The highlight of Marina Bay Sands is undoubtedly the Infinity Pool on the SkyPark, which is the world’s largest rooftop pool. Floating on the edge of the pool while gazing at the cityscape is an unforgettable experience. The SkyPark also houses observation decks and restaurants offering gourmet dining, further elevating the luxury quotient.

For entertainment, Marina Bay Sands has something for everyone. The integrated resort includes a high-end shopping mall, an impressive casino, and the ArtScience Museum, which hosts cutting-edge exhibitions. The theater regularly features international performances, adding to the cultural allure.

While the experience is undoubtedly luxurious, it comes with a premium price tag. Some guests might find the property bustling, especially during peak tourist seasons. However, the overall ambiance, impeccable service, and unmatched facilities make it worth the splurge.

In conclusion, Marina Bay Sands is more than just a hotel—it’s a destination in itself, perfect for those seeking indulgence, entertainment, and iconic memories in Singapore.","Edited 9 months ago on

Dinesh,5/5,"My recent visit to Singapore was fab, and the highlight of this incredible journey was undeniably my stay at Marina Bay Sands. From the moment I set foot in this iconic hotel, I was spellbound by the sheer beauty of the bay area and the rich cultural experiences that surrounded me.

The first thing that left me in awe was the breathtaking view of the city skyline from the rooftop infinity pool. The sight of the glittering skyscrapers and the stunning Marina Bay was nothing short of magical, especially during the evening when the city lights up. I could have spent hours just soaking in this incredible panorama.

The Bay Area itself is a sight to behold. The calm waters of the bay, juxtaposed with the bustling cityscape, create a unique and captivating atmosphere. A leisurely stroll along the bay promenade allowed me to absorb the vibrant energy of this place and appreciate the blend of modernity and tradition that Singapore so perfectly encapsulates.

Overall, my visit to Marina Bay Sands in Singapore was nothing short of extraordinary. The hotel, the bay area, and the cultural experiences exceeded my expectations and made my first trip to Singapore a memorable one. If you're seeking a blend of luxury, culture, and breathtaking views, this is the place to be. I left with a heavy heart, but with memories I will cherish for a lifetime.","Edited a year ago on

The first thing that left me in awe was the breathtaking view of the city skyline from the rooftop infinity pool. The sight of the glittering skyscrapers and the stunning Marina Bay was nothing short of magical, especially during the evening when the city lights up. I could have spent hours just soaking in this incredible panorama.

The Bay Area itself is a sight to behold. The calm waters of the bay, juxtaposed with the bustling cityscape, create a unique and captivating atmosphere. A leisurely stroll along the bay promenade allowed me to absorb the vibrant energy of this place and appreciate the blend of modernity and tradition that Singapore so perfectly encapsulates.

Overall, my visit to Marina Bay Sands in Singapore was nothing short of extraordinary. The hotel, the bay area, and the cultural experiences exceeded my expectations and made my first trip to Singapore a memorable one. If you're seeking a blend of luxury, culture, and breathtaking views, this is the place to be. I left with a heavy heart, but with memories I will cherish for a lifetime."
Georgi Bates,5/5,We had beautiful rooms with views over the gardens and out to the Bay. I loved seeing all the cargo ships in the background and the light show at night. The only disappointing part was we had booked two joining rooms and it wasn’t organised so we were on two different floors. It wasn’t full so this should have been organised. We were in the second tower though rooms 1970 and 2192 which were renovated as other parts of hotel weren’t renovated.,"a year ago on

Alaa Hafiz,5/5,"My recent stay at the iconic Marina Bay Sands in Singapore was nothing short of exceptional. From the moment I arrived, I was thoroughly impressed by the level of service and attention to detail that the resort provided.

One of the highlights of my stay was the unexpected room upgrade I received, which afforded me breathtaking views of the Singapore skyline and Marina Bay. Being able to wake up and enjoy the stunning vistas each morning was truly a treat. Swimming in the infinity pool was an experience I'll never forget.

What really sets Marina Bay Sands apart, though, was the exceptional level of service. The resort provided me with temporary cards that allowed me to access the swimming pool and reserve time slots for the shower facilities, even after I had checked out. This thoughtful touch ensured that I could continue to enjoy the resort's amenities on my final day, without any hassle.

I cannot recommend Marina Bay Sands highly enough. Whether you're visiting Singapore for business or leisure, this iconic resort offers an unparalleled blend of luxury, service, and unforgettable experiences. I left feeling refreshed, rejuvenated.","a year ago on

Manoj T W,5/5,"Marina Bay Sands is one of Singapore’s most iconic landmarks and a symbol of modern architectural brilliance. The complex consists of three towering hotel blocks connected at the top by the SkyPark, an engineering marvel that offers panoramic views of the city skyline and Marina Bay.

One of the biggest draws is the world-famous infinity pool, located on the rooftop. Reserved exclusively for hotel guests, the pool provides an unforgettable experience—floating above the city while enjoying spectacular views. Many visitors book at least one night’s stay just to access it, and while prices can be high, booking during off-peak periods or through special promotions can help you save significantly.

Beyond the pool, the resort is home to a large shopping mall, a casino, and a wide variety of dining options ranging from food court fare to high-end restaurants by celebrity chefs. The quality of food across the property is consistently excellent.

What makes Marina Bay Sands truly special is its dual perspective: you can enjoy stunning views of both the futuristic Gardens by the Bay and the dazzling city skyline, especially at night when the lights come alive.

Whether you’re staying overnight, dining, or just visiting the observation deck, it’s an experience that’s absolutely worth having at least once in your lifetime.","Edited 4 months ago on

The hotel room we stayed in was an original room (now they are going through renovation and upgraded rooms have new furniture) and it was a good size, with a massive TV and nice bathroom.

Shubham Prasad,5/5,"An Iconic Luxury Experience

Marina Bay Sands is nothing short of spectacular. From the moment you arrive, you’re enveloped in luxury and grandeur. The architecture is iconic, and the view from the SkyPark is absolutely breathtaking, offering panoramic vistas of Singapore’s skyline that are worth the visit alone.

The rooms are spacious, modern, and well-appointed, with many offering stunning views of the bay. The infinity pool is the star attraction—swimming at the top of the world is an experience that you simply can’t miss. It’s a bit crowded at times, but the view and atmosphere make it worth it.

Beyond the rooms and pool, the complex has everything you could need—high-end shopping, world-class dining, and a casino. The staff are attentive and ensure your stay is as comfortable as possible.

Marina Bay Sands isn’t just a hotel; it’s a destination in itself. Whether you’re staying here or just visiting, it’s an experience that defines luxury in Singapore. Highly recommended for anyone looking to indulge in the best the city has to offer.

You can modify it based on your personal experience or preferences!","a year ago on

The beauty of the hotel rooms and other facilities are indescribable. The market located below the hotel is excellent with all the amenities. The eateries here offer very tasty good food. But the area is crowded because of the large number of people.","Edited a year ago on

Nitin Ghogare,4/5,"Awesome place to visit and explore. I would suggest to visit in the evening as the climate becomes very pleasant. The breeze due to the waters feels just amazing. The banking capital looks surreal in the evening. If you take the boat ride, it will give you complete view of the hotels, banks and everything around Marina Bay. The Merlin however wasn't functional. One of the best place to visit.","a year ago on

We got tickets pre booked to zoom up to the Observatory Level a couple of days before. If you're there for sunset, you will need to select ""peak"" timing and choose your preferred arrival time.
The only services you will see up on the roof area is one shop selling snacks and drinks. The views of course are amazing!!","a year ago on

Blue & Green Traveling Team,5/5,"Loved our stay here! On the expensive side, but decided to splurge for a two night stay after our cruise! Room was big and clean, however, it looked a bit tired with nicks and scratches on the furnishings! I expected being that it is a highly praised and visible hotel that everything would be on the luxurious side, but I have seen better. On the brighter side, the hotel is centrally located with all the highlights of what Singapore has to offer within walking distance. The hotel also boasts a high-end mall with food court. It does get extremely busy so plan accordingly if you'd like to get something to eat and to see any light shows, need to show up at least an hour before to get prime spot. Any the infinity pool was amazing overlooking the city! We went at 6 am in the morning for a swim and no one was around until about 6:30 am then the crowd started to build up. All in all, it was an amazing stay and would still recommend the hotel!","a year ago on

Go if you love gambling, probably the better of the 2 casinos. Alternatively, for the gram, there's the overcrowded pool.

Angela Edwards,5/5,"It was a fabulous  experience  from  check-in to check-out. Staff were friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable. We travelled as a family of adult children, and our room was upgraded for free! Both rooms had superb views over the supertree grove and glass houses so we could watch the light show from our balcony.  We got priority  access to the observation  deck and visited the pool twice. Loved the fact there  was an adult only area, too.
We didn't dine there, and the only issue  I have is the fact that everything  in Singapore  harbour area that's good gets booked far in advance.  We were warned about this the day before check-in and didn't  do anything about it. My advice would be to choose a restaurant  within the hotel as they are excellent (not like hotel food in the UK), and come highly  recommended  on Trip Advisor.

All in all, it was an amazing  experience.  Would love to come again someday, and I will sort out eateries before  we arrive!","2 years ago on

Ahmed Alqahtani,5/5,"Marina Bay Sands is not just a hotel; it’s a destination in itself—a place where luxury, innovation, and grandeur converge to create an unforgettable experience. From the moment you approach this iconic structure, the stunning architecture captures your attention. The three soaring towers connected by the breathtaking SkyPark have become synonymous with the Singapore skyline, and the reality of staying here exceeds every expectation.

The rooms are nothing short of spectacular. Whether you’re enjoying panoramic views of the city skyline, the bustling harbour, or the lush Gardens by the Bay, every window offers a postcard-perfect scene. The interiors are sleek, modern, and impeccably designed, providing comfort and luxury in equal measure. The attention to detail is evident, from the plush bedding to the high-tech amenities that ensure your stay is seamless and indulgent.

But what truly sets Marina Bay Sands apart is its unparalleled range of facilities. The SkyPark infinity pool is a must-visit—swimming at the edge of the world, with the city sprawled out below. You are an experience that’s hard to match. It’s not just a pool; it’s a statement, a place where you feel like you’re floating above the city.

Dining at Marina Bay Sands is a journey through culinary excellence. The hotel houses a plethora of world-class restaurants, each offering unique and exquisite dishes. From celebrity chef establishments to more casual yet equally delightful dining spots, the options are endless and cater to every taste. Whether you’re in the mood for gourmet cuisine or a quick, delicious bite, you’ll find something to satisfy your palate.

For those looking to indulge in some retail therapy, the Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands offers a luxurious shopping experience, featuring high-end brands and designer boutiques. The integrated resort also boasts an impressive casino, a theatre showcasing world-class performances and an art-science museum, ensuring that there’s always something exciting to do.

The service is top-notch across the board. The staff are attentive, professional, and genuinely eager to make your stay exceptional. From check-in to check-out, every interaction is smooth and pleasant, making you feel pampered at every step.

Avinash Yadav,5/5,"Marina Bay Sands is one of Singapore’s most iconic landmarks, a luxury hotel that is more than just a place to stay—it’s an experience in itself. During my recent visit, I was left in awe of its architectural grandeur, world-class amenities, and stunning views. Adding to this, my dining experience at LAVO Italian Restaurant & Rooftop Bar was a highlight of the trip, though there were some areas where it could have been better.

**Marina Bay Sands Experience:**

From the moment you arrive at Marina Bay Sands, the sheer scale of the place is impressive. The hotel consists of three massive towers connected by a SkyPark, which offers one of the best panoramic views of the city. Checking in was seamless despite the large number of guests, and the staff were attentive and professional throughout our stay.

The rooms were spacious, well-appointed, and offered floor-to-ceiling windows with breathtaking views of Singapore’s skyline or the bay. The attention to detail in the rooms, from the plush bedding to the luxurious bathrooms, made our stay incredibly comfortable. The location of Marina Bay Sands is also unbeatable—it’s situated near many of Singapore’s key attractions, such as Gardens by the Bay, the ArtScience Museum, and the Merlion, making it perfect for tourists looking to explore the city.

However, what sets Marina Bay Sands apart is its world-famous infinity pool located on the 57th floor. Floating in the pool while taking in the views of the city skyline is an experience you won’t forget. It’s worth noting that the pool area does get crowded, especially during peak hours, so it’s best to visit early in the morning or late in the evening for a more relaxed atmosphere.

For entertainment, Marina Bay Sands also boasts a world-class casino, high-end shopping at The Shoppes, and an array of restaurants, bars, and cafes. The hotel’s wide variety of dining options ensures there’s something for everyone, from casual eateries to fine dining.

**Dining at LAVO Restaurant:**

One of the dining highlights at Marina Bay Sands was our dinner at LAVO Italian Restaurant & Rooftop Bar. Situated on the 57th floor, LAVO offers stunning 360-degree views of Singapore’s skyline, and the ambiance is unbeatable. The warm lighting, plush seating, and open-air terrace create a sophisticated yet relaxed atmosphere. Whether you’re seated indoors or outdoors, you’re in for a visual treat.

LAVO’s menu is an impressive mix of Italian-American cuisine. We started with the *Fried Calamari* and *Meatball*, both of which were delicious. The calamari was perfectly crisp, and the meatball was tender and flavorful, served in a rich tomato sauce. For our main course, we ordered the *Spaghetti Carbonara* and *Lobster Ravioli*. The carbonara was creamy and flavorful, though slightly on the heavier side, while the lobster ravioli was a standout dish, with perfectly cooked pasta and generous portions of lobster.

However, as much as we enjoyed the food, the prices were on the higher side, which is to be expected given the prime location. The service, while friendly, could have been more attentive. It took longer than expected for our orders to be taken, and the food arrived slightly later than anticipated. While the ambiance and views made up for the slight delays, it’s something that could be improved for a more seamless dining experience.

The rooftop bar at LAVO is a must-visit for anyone looking to enjoy cocktails with a view. The drinks were well-crafted, and sipping a cocktail while watching the city lights come to life was a memorable experience.

**Conclusion:**

Marina Bay Sands is a premier destination in Singapore, offering a luxurious stay with unparalleled views, world-class amenities, and a range of dining options. The infinity pool alone makes it worth the visit, and its location is perfect for exploring Singapore. LAVO Restaurant, with its stunning views and delicious Italian-American cuisine, is a great dining spot, though a few tweaks in service would make it even better.

Our room was in Tower 1 on the 14th floor and they were doing renovations above our room so the noise was sufficient enough that we requested a different room in a different tower but all the rooms were booked.  The manger was amazing, it blew my mind away! He helped us find another hotel and booked a room for us.  This was the best experience I’ve ever had in my life.  I would definitely recommend this hotel and would love to stay there in the future!!!","a year ago on

Victoria SMG,5/5,"Beautiful mall, hotel, casino, and architecture. It’s a very clean city and area filled with things to do. The US dollar is still worth a bit more here - so worked out for us. If you’re not from Singapore - be sure to bring your passport and visa to the casino or else they won’t let you in. The casino provided free 24 hr bag check which is great if you’re stopping here for a day visit/during a layover.","a year ago on

Nick Zandes,5/5,"A beautiful hotel to stay in. Our newly renovated room was awesome with great views of the Gardens by the Bay day and night. The Infinity Pool on the roof was, well the most standout of them all.  Pools were separated for the adults and kids section, so for all us adults could enjoy the views and food/drinks in peace and harmony without screaming and jumping kids.  All staff at all levels Inc pool staff were great, very friendly and professional. It was great to have direct access to the gardens by the bay and the shoppes at Marina Bay.  If you ever visit Singapore, you have to visit Gardens by the bay even if you don't stay at the hotel, but if you do stay at the hotel,  the views from our room were magnificent.","a year ago on

Vini Jaiswal,5/5,"Went to stroll around the city after an amazing work day. It was a completely unexpected experience. Loved the water show, the food, the inclusion of almost so many different brands in the building and some of the unique luxurious dining options too. The Apple Store managed to leave its charms at the Center of the bay. Highly recommend the water show which showcases at 8PM and 9 PM Singapore time.","2 years ago on

Sheetal pandya,5/5,A must visit place in Singapore if you are a tourist.. a nice panoramic view of the whole Singapore city in one look from 56th floor. I suggest pre-booking the tickets in advance as they allow a limited crowd on the top floor. The entry to the top floor is from tower 3. We went when it was raining. It was a breath taking view if you go in rain..but mostly they close the entry due to high floor and thunder.,"Edited a year ago on

Zak,3/5,"The hotel itself and all the facilities look incredible. We didn't stay here, but anyone who comes to Singapore will pass through it's doors. The only reason that I'm giving it 3 stars is really because we went up to a restaurant at the top of hotel on the platform. The SGN 30 per ticket is redeemable on for and drink. It was fine, in terms of the food and drinks on offer, but it was overcrowded and the staff, salary, didn't really offer a great service. So in some ways, I wish we'd just paid to be on the actual viewing deck. It's a thing to do, but it's a coin toss whether to dine or do just the viewing deck","a year ago on

Toni is traveling,5/5,"Outstanding hotel. I don't have any complaints about it, only compliments:
- professional staff (for welcome, restaurant, room service, etc). Also did their best to accommodate us as soon as possible
- the rooms are excellent, great amenities and automations for everything, high tech
- the infinity pool, one of the best in the world: very high up in the sky with great views. Fruits refreshments throughout the day
- great and complete main restaurant, both breakfast and dinner buffets
- luxurious overall, like a mini mall with various stores and restaurants
- good location, various nearby attractions: Gardens by the Bay, Singapore Flyer, Spectra show, etc, nearby the MRT subway too

My advice: get a room with gardens by the bay view, both day and night the view is nice and calming, during the night you can also see the Gardens lights and music show. On the opposite side you have the city and the lake below, I personally prefer the Gardens view","a year ago on

Kaylee Nicole,4/5,Only explored the observation deck. $25 which is a lot. We came 45 MN before close but that was still enough time. Fast elevator up and down. Short line!

Would love to stay there but it's so expensive... there are fancy shops below that anyone can walk through. A very enjoyable experience.,"3 years ago on

Muhammed Mustafa,2/5,"Love the views but that’s all they are charging for. Quite frankly the infrastructure is really old and the rooms are quite basic. My room smelled like cigarettes which got me a headache, they put an air freshener but this is something I have never experienced in a 5 star.
The service of the hotel is not the best. I found the staff quite unfriendly and would not even greet their guests which I found odd. I mentioned to them in an email exchange that we will be staying for our anniversary and they said they will be sending a dessert over once we check in which they didn’t. Who even does that.
Overall I would not recommend it, there are many much better hotels in Singapore for the same price or even much cheaper.","a year ago on

János Dézsi,4/5,"The hotel is great in industrializing the 5-star experience. Do not attempt online checkin, because then your stuff won’t reach your room from the drop-off and there will be issues with the online deposit. This simply does not work as you would expect. The room is quite nice on higher floors, but they started some maintenance next to our room and as they left an emergency exit open and blocked the beeping noise was quite disturbing in our room during the night. We were offered a new room, but as we would had to move our staff the night before our checkout, it did not make any sense. We would have expected much more from such a high ranked hotel and considering these it does not worth the money. Maybe one time to check the pool. I never had to call or contact the front desk so often in any other hotel like here, and we are not picky at all. The service is nice and the staff is polite but not flexible at all. Mixing business people with people on vacation is also not a great idea.","a year ago on

Jonas Nørgaard,3/5,"We feel like all we do is wait at this hotel. We are checking in to the Orchid Suite today after a day in the Premier King room. We've been waiting 15 minutes in line to get a table for breakfast, no one had time to serve us at breakfast, and the food was not very good, we waited in line to check in, we waited in line to check out, the restaurant makes mistakes on the order at lunch. The check out-person told us we could keep our access to the first room while waiting for the suite to get ready, but our key cards stopped working so we had to spend another 30-40 minutes with the check in counter to get access to our luggage which was still in the old room. Finally, after spending $1,200 for a night in their suite we were asked to walk to an ATM to withdraw $2 for stamps so they could send two postcards for us. OK, thanks

It is evident that the service as a Premier Room customer is low. The service level as a Suite customer is much higher - use Club 55 as much as possible! The service at Club 55 lives up to our expectations and service at other great hotels and Club 55 together with the pool is what gives this hotel 3 out of 5 stars. This was a nice change after the first day. We have stayed at 7 hotels in the past 30 days, and even though the service level increased a lot after booking the suite, this hotel comes in at rank 6 out of 7 hotels (second last).

Best time to visit is evening around the sunset and then continue till Singapore lights are on, this way you can enjoy hot day and night views and it’s amazing beauty. Tickets are 36 SGD, better to book online on marina bay sands website since counter tickets are sold much earlier in the day. They take a nice pic at the entrance however they charge quiet a bit for hardcopy of the photos.

We stayed on the 50th floor in a room that faced the gardens by the bay. The room was gorgeous and very comfortable. The pool really is the main reason we stayed here and the view doesn't disappoint. It was a little hard to get drink/food service but other than that we had a lovely time around the pool. The gym is a little small considering the number of rooms at the hotel. We didn't want to leave. Such a wonderful experience.,"2 years ago on

Nadeesha Athukorala,5/5,"I like to call it ""The heart of Singapore."" Because,This is the major and iconic place in Singapore.The view of the city skyline from the rooftop infinity pool is breathtaking.
I think It's a Lovely and Awesome place to visit and explore.
I would suggest to visit in the evening as the climate becomes very pleasant.If you take the boat ride, it will give you a complete view of the hotels, banks and everything around Marina Bay. It's definitely one of the best hotel in the world.  ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️","Edited a year ago on

Eva,4/5,"A good hotel to stay at - easy access to shopping, and the staff there are friendly. The infinity pool provides great scenery and pictures (it is only open to hotel guests, but you can pay a fee to go to the rooftop). There is also a wide variety of food choices, so it’s definitely a good place to visit!

However, the waiting time to check-in takes quite some time","2 years ago on

Nikita Kalantri,5/5,"Never ever disappointed by this place. Visited many times, but always feel wonderful.

It is a must visit place in Singapore. A huge shopping mall with a Casino, multiple restaurants, luxury brands, etc available.

The outside area is just something else. A floating apple store, and a floating LV store, with an amazing view of high rise buildings and the city all lit up.

A light and sound fountain show happens Fri - Sun.

My room on the 44th floor overlooked the light garden.
Patrick, in the reception area was especially helpful in all aspects. I am a single elderly traveler and he was outstanding.
Best of all was the restaurants.  Blossom for quick dim sum but for something very special go to floor 57 Ca la Vie. 5*****.","a year ago on

It's a popular tourist spot and for very good reason.

Ishani Mehta,5/5,"We were concerned about the scale of the hotel and the number of guests and how that might impact our stay, but from even before reaching the hotel, we were so wonderfully assisted by a personalized check in staff as part of premier check-in services that we didn't need to worry about a thing. The luggage magically came to the room and left the room without us needing to supervise, thanks to the very able luggage staff and the exceptional operational management. It is worth staying in the suites for this premiere experience. Each dining option offered by the hotel is just fabulous, with the stunning views from Club 55, the beautifully crafted cakes and savouries at Renku, and especially the widespread and delicious breakfast selections at Rise. The ease with which the scale of operation at breakfast at Rise is managed is just remarkable. The swimming pool experience was also memorable, and we managed to go at times when the crowds were a little less. The suite itself was beautifully appointed, with all necessities placed in the correct position. The views were stunning..we were lucky to get a corner room for an Orchid suite, which offered both city and garden views with sunset and sunrise views. The large windows with mechanised curtains truly elevate the experience. The bathroom and all its amenities, including the selection of toiletries, was extremely premiere. And it is extremely easy to access the towers, the mall, and the various dining places due to the logical layout of the whole complex. The only thing thing that needs a bit of improvement is the elevator waiting time when exiting the sky deck. Overall, amazing stay and we will come back.","3 years ago on

Freddy,1/5,"The food court service and food standard at MBS managed by Koufu is worse than a hawker centre. Rasapura Masters is the name of this food court at MBS which is managed by the Koufu. This is not the first time we patronize this place and the latest incident really makes me feel pissed off and decided to leave a bad review for them. Firstly, we bought coffee and tea from them, the taste is so bland and diluted. Therefore i return back to the beverage counter asking for more condensed milk to be added. But to my surprise instead of condensed milk sugar was added instead? Is this the correct way to brew and serve a cup of coffee/tea which cost $2.20 to the customer and give substandard quality? We don't mind to pay extra but it is really not worth as hawker centre coffee is even better than them! And the food court executive is standing at the beverage order counter allowing all this to happen? Secondly, we bought ice kacang from the dessert counter and the portion and appearance is totally different from what is display on the signage. I feel cheated as this is not way to do business and it costs $4.30 for this kind of dessert? I approach the staff making the dessert and she rudely told me is like that one, the display is only a photo! Come on shouldn't you make the finished product to be almost the same as display or else this is actually considered as cheating customers. Example if i sell fishball noodles, my signage display is three fishball and some fishcake but the end product i cook out i only put one fishball into the noodles. Is it correct to do so? I don't think so! This foodcourt is simply a disgrace to the customers especially to the tourists and ruined Singapore food and beverages heritage which they represented at MBS...","Edited 8 months ago on

I was amazed because I was just getting the deluxe room and then they said they don't have any available and they upgraded our room into executive sweet for free!!! Good deal Marina Bay! Thank you! worth the stay! The staff is very friendly and nice. I ask for a match after 5 mins they delivered it. I like the place because it's just adjacent to the Mall and to the food court which has a cheaper food price. The infinity pool is amazing friendly staff. There is one time I forgot my wallet in the room and we were hungry at the infinity pool we ordered our food and they just charge my room no. and when we check out they just automatically deduct it to our deposit. Perfect place for a proposal facing the garden bay and the flower dome. Thank you, Marina Bay Sands, for the great experience!

Breakfast was included, and do choose the one on the first floor, not the 57th one.  The one on the first has a TON of selections.  Restaurants in the mall food court were affordable.

Chee Seng Lee,1/5,"I attended two dinner functions. Last month.

Food was bad. Service staff were part timers. The most amazing and non compliant was the food plate that was served to customers were smelly and it was as though as rinsed and dried using oily water without soap. Both supervisors were made aware and all they could do was to apologies on behalf of housekeeping. We had raised the feedback to the event owner and no news were heard. The plates were really smelly reaks of Stench of sully water.

Despite raising it as food hygiene issues, all the supervisor did was apologies and scrambled to find clean plates. We didn't touch the last3 dishes due to the aftermath of bad smell and taste right on the table.

For the price you are charging, we expected more.

The service was so-so, and we had a tough check in process at 2am.  It took an eternity and they didn’t have our two rooms anywhere near each other - even in separate towers.  It is also too big to give a feel for any sort of personal touch, but we knew that going in and it was fine.","3 years ago on

Bring your own water - it's a pain in the rear to find bottled water anywhere. On top of that, stores will only give you shot glass sized cups of water. Otherwise, enjoy your time there and at the adjoining mall!","a year ago on

Everything looked and worked perfectly, all the way down to the toilet that automatically raises/lowers the lid when you enter/leave.  Views on all sides are great.  Service was attentive and responsive without being overbearing.  Location is awesome, nextdoor to gardens on the bay park and connected to Marina Bay shopping.  And, that famous rooftop pool is a stellar experience and as it is open 6am-11pm, star watching is an option.","2 years ago on

Super convenient that the city train has a stop at the hotel. We were able to navigate the city easily and get to and from the airport.

Check-in was smooth, we were lucky that our room was available ahead of standard check-in times. After a 13hr flight into Singapore that was great news!!

Roof Top Infinity Pool - Of course the is a must see! Recommend going at sunset.

Matthew Doyle,5/5,"When visiting Singapore, a stay at the MBS is a must. The unique architecture and beautiful design greeted us en route from the airport.

Arriving at the property we witnessed an air traffic control level of coordination across 5 drive through lanes.

We were greeted by multiple bag handlers and brought into the lobby for check-in.
While waiting a brief 15 minutes, a member of reception walked the queue and offered bottled water. There must have been 20 different receptionists checking guests in.

After getting checked in we went up to our room on the 9th floor, room 93 facing the Gardens by the Bay. The room was as luxurious as you would imagine for the price paid. All the amenities you could think of from coffee/tea, a variety of premade alcohol cocktails, snacks and meals, stocked mini fridge, complimentary candies, and all the appropriate drinkware.

The bathroom offered a tub for two, double vanity's, fully stocked Salvatore Ferragamo soaps, shampoo, conditioner, body lotion. Additionally, the vanity drawer was stocked with nail kits, dental kits, hair brush and comb. There was a walk-in shower with a rain forest shower or an angled shower head and a frosted glass door. Right next to it was a motion sensing toilet bidet with a full multifunction control panel and frosted glass door.

The beds were two plush queen sized mattresses and for entertainment and various information availability was a 90 inch TV screen on the wall directly in front of the beds.

The last piece was a walk out balcony with two chairs and a table. The views to the Gardens by the Bay and the overall harbor were incredible and definitely worth the upgrade.

If you have the means I would encourage staying here every time in Singapore if not, book it at least once for a night or two to gain access to the 57th floor rooftop infinity pool. Or you can enjoy one of the many fine dining options.","a year ago on

Noman Khan Aadam-Zaad,5/5,"Marina Bay Sands Singapore is an iconic landmark in the heart of Singapore that is known for its luxurious accommodations, world-class entertainment, and exceptional dining options. This magnificent hotel and entertainment complex is an ambitious project that has set a new standard for hospitality and entertainment in Southeast Asia.

One of the most impressive aspects of Marina Bay Sands is the ambition behind the project. The development of the complex was a massive undertaking that required extensive planning and execution. The result is a breathtaking structure that features three hotel towers, a massive shopping mall, a convention center, a museum, a casino, and a stunning rooftop infinity pool. The sheer scale of the project is a testament to the vision and dedication of the team behind it.

The staff at Marina Bay Sands are another impressive aspect of the complex. From the moment you arrive, you are greeted by friendly and professional staff members who go above and beyond to make your stay comfortable and enjoyable. The staff is well-trained and knowledgeable, and they are always willing to assist with any questions or concerns you may have. They take pride in their work, and it shows in their attention to detail and the high level of service they provide.

One of the things that impressed me most about the staff at Marina Bay Sands is the way they explain the various features and amenities of the complex. From the moment you check in, you are given a comprehensive overview of everything the complex has to offer, including information on the various dining options, entertainment venues, and shopping experiences. The staff takes the time to answer any questions you may have, and they do so in a friendly and informative manner.

Overall, Marina Bay Sands is an impressive complex that is well worth a visit. The ambition behind the project is evident in every aspect of the complex, from the stunning architecture to the exceptional staff.

M CH,5/5,"We first stayed at Marina Bay Sands 13 years ago, and this time we returned for just one night. Check-in was smooth and efficient — we received a temporary room card that already gave us access to the pool, which was very convenient. We decided to do some shopping first, and when we returned to collect our official room cards, we were pleasantly surprised to learn that we had been given an upgrade. This gesture was truly appreciated.

As always, the pool and the food were excellent. You have the option to enjoy breakfast either by the pool or downstairs. If you're looking for a large buffet and don’t mind a lively atmosphere, the downstairs option is ideal. However, if you prefer a quieter, more refined experience with a set menu, the poolside breakfast is the better choice.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would be happy to return again in the future.","a month ago on

Ceniya J,5/5,"While Marina Bay Sands dazzles visitors with its luxury shopping, world-class restaurants, and breathtaking architecture, my lasting memory comes from a group often overlooked: the housekeeping team.

During what was otherwise a very difficult trip, these professionals became the highlight of my stay. The scale of their work is extraordinary—cleaning massive, high-tech rooms with meticulous precision, restocking coolers and amenities, and ensuring no detail is overlooked, all within tight time frames. As someone with severe OCD, I notice everything, and I was genuinely in awe.

One housekeeper, in particular, came to refill my ice bucket—something I didn’t even need—yet she bowed repeatedly and apologized as though she were inconveniencing me. Her humility and dedication were deeply touching. Later, another staff member surprised me with a vegan birthday cake, complete with a candle. I had forgotten it was even my birthday, but that thoughtful gesture nearly brought me to tears. It wasn’t just a dessert; it was a reminder that I was seen and valued.

In a hotel renowned for grandeur, it’s the quiet diligence of the housekeeping team that, in my view, forms the true backbone of Marina Bay Sands. They made me feel special, cared for, and genuinely welcome. I would return not just for the stunning rooms, but to personally thank and see these remarkable individuals again.

Thank you so much for this experience, it made my birthday trip.","a month ago on

ChuLuxe Explorer,5/5,"Marina Bay Sands is one of the most stunning places I’ve visited in Singapore. That day I spent time walking around, enjoying the view, and taking photos. The architecture is so iconic and the whole place feels elegant and beautifully designed. Even just strolling along the promenade was relaxing and memorable.

What made the day truly unforgettable was having dinner at the rooftop bar, right at the highest point of the building. The view was absolutely breathtaking. I watched the sunset paint the sky in warm colors, followed by a full moon rising above the city skyline. It was one of those moments that just takes your breath away. Everything felt magical. The atmosphere, the view, the food, the soft breeze,  it all came together perfectly.

Whether you’re staying at the hotel or just visiting, this is a place you should not miss. It’s a must-see in Singapore and a memory I’ll always keep with me.","2 months ago on

As a tunnel engineer by day and IT security expert by night, I know a thing or two about digging deep and securing the perimeter. This hotel's 5-star service and comfy beds made me feel like I'd finally found the hidden tunnel to a good night's sleep. 5/5 stars, would recommend to anyone looking for a secure and cozy stay!""

The architecture is iconic, and the atmosphere around the area is vibrant, especially at night when the lights and the skyline come alive. It’s truly one of the must-see landmarks in Singapore, and we really enjoyed just walking around and taking photos.","4 weeks ago on

leotrails,5/5,"This is one of the iconic spots I always visit when I’m in Singapore, and it totally lives up to the hype. From the moment I walk in, it feels like I’m stepping into something grand, boujee, and massive. The Shoppes here offer luxury shopping at its finest: sleek, shiny, and filled with high-end brands like Chanel, Gucci, and Louis Vuitton. Basically, it’s window-shopping heaven if you’re not there to splurge.

But it’s not all about designer labels. There are great dining options too, from fancy restaurants to casual cafés with beautiful views of the waterfront. And yes, the indoor canal with gondola rides adds a fun, over-the-top touch. There’s also the casino: sleek, expansive, and brimming with indulgences for those who want a premium gaming experience.

Even if you’re not buying anything, it’s a cool spot to stroll, people-watch, and soak in all the glam.","Edited a month ago on

Tiago Rodrigues,5/5,We went up to the observation deck that has a wonderful view over the city. Access is through the entrance next to the Hotel. A ticket of about €25 is paid. The ascent is made in a fast elevator but nothing special. Upstairs there is a restaurant of the Hotel but you can’t access it without being a guest of the Hotel. It’s worth it for the view of the city. There could be something else at the top or access to some lounge.,"2 weeks ago on

Himanshu Johari,5/5,"We booked a stay at Marina Bay Sands to celebrate my son’s birthday — it was his dream to swim in the infinity pool, and we wanted to make it unforgettable. I booked two suites for our family, kids, and nieces so everyone could be part of the celebration.

The rooms and the pool were simply amazing, and the kids had the time of their lives. But what truly stood out was the exceptional service, especially from Erica, who gave us a check-in experience unlike anything I’ve had before.

We were greeted right at the car and taken directly to our suite, where the kids were welcomed with chocolates and apples. While the little ones ran around, excited and full of joy, my family and I completed the check-in formalities in the comfort of our room — no queues, no waiting, just pure ease.

From start to finish, everything about our stay was thoughtful, seamless, and special. Thank you, Marina Bay Sands, for making my son’s birthday a memory we will cherish forever.","a month ago on

My third trip but partner was first time that y spent time walking around, enjoying the view, max walking and taking photos. Every moments of the trip memorable includes among experiences. architecture is so iconic and the whole area feels elegant and beautifully designed. Even just strolling along the promenade was relaxing and memorable.
What made the week truly unforgettable was having dinner at the rooftop, making TikTok, right at the highest point of the building. The view was absolutely breathtaking, same time watched the sunset paint the sky in warm colours followed by a full moon rising above the sky line Everything felt way magical. The atmosphere and the sky views together perfectly not for only us. Highly recommended and don’t miss the chance if you’re planning to visit 🇸🇬.

S J,4/5,"Marina Bay Sands is truly a symbol of Singapore, and it’s a place I visit every year.

With so many rooms and guests, compared to other hotels of the same class, it doesn’t give the feeling of personalized care while moving around the hotel. However, the service at the lobby and concierge is excellent.

A few years ago, the hotel underwent a major renovation, and the rooms have been updated to a higher standard, which I’m really happy with. Since COVID, hotel prices in Singapore have risen across the board, and Marina Bay Sands is no exception. It’s now hard to find a room for under $700 a night.

Still, the signature infinity pool is something you just can’t miss :) I often bring guests here, and the growing number of F&B outlets offers a variety of options, which is very satisfying.","3 weeks ago on

And then, the infinity pool… absolutely surreal! Swimming above the city, watching the sunset paint the skyline in gold and pink hues, was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. It felt like pure magic.

I’ve been here a few times, sometimes just to chill with colleagues or bring visiting friends around. The vibe is classy but still welcoming. The views from the observation deck or even just around the promenade area are incredible, especially at night when the skyline lights up.

Even if you’re not staying at the hotel, there’s so much to explore — the Shoppes, the food court, the canal, and of course the light and water show outside. It’s one of those places you always end up coming back to, whether for the experience or to just enjoy the scenery.","3 months ago on

Ngọc Báu,5/5,"1. The Landscape – Clean, Refined, and Aesthetically Pleasing

What struck me most upon arriving in Singapore was how neatly orchestrated everything felt — as if every corner had been thoughtfully composed. The city is meticulously planned yet still breathes with nature. Green spaces are not just “added in,” they’re woven into the very fabric of the urban environment — from vast parks to rooftop gardens and tree-lined streets.

Each district has its own flavor: Marina Bay is sleek and futuristic, Arab Street is a burst of color and culture, while Gardens by the Bay feels like stepping into a dream where technology and nature intertwine.

2. Singapore at Night – Where the City Truly Shines

If Singapore in the daytime is a pristine canvas, then nighttime turns it into a masterpiece. As the sun sets, the city transforms — illuminated by thousands of lights that reflect off glass towers and gentle waterways.

Key landmarks like Marina Bay Sands, Clarke Quay, Helix Bridge, and the lotus-shaped ArtScience Museum light up in ways that feel almost cinematic. Walking along the Singapore River at night, you can’t help but slow down — not from tiredness, but from awe. The “Spectra” light and water show at Marina Bay isn’t just a spectacle — it’s a moment that stays with you.

3. The Rhythm of Life – Energetic, Yet Graceful

Despite being a hub of finance, tech, and tourism, Singapore doesn’t feel overwhelming. People move quickly, but not anxiously. The city runs with purpose but still feels respectful, clean, and kind.

There’s a deep sense of order and mindfulness in how locals interact with public spaces — how they queue, how they keep the streets spotless, how they balance modern life with cultural roots. It's a quiet discipline that leaves a lasting impression.","2 months ago on

Sher,5/5,"Absolutely incredible 11/10!!
We initially reserved a king bed room but wanted to change to a double queen room during check-in, and the staff at the check-in counter, Yve, went above and beyond to arrange a double queen room for us! Amazing service!
We stayed in tower 3 level 29 and our room was so beautiful and spacious! And the view overlooking gardens by the bay was stunning!
I especially loved the attention to detail from the housekeeping staff. They not only helped to clean our room so spotlessly, the little things they do such as tying up our phone charger wires truly amazed me!","3 months ago on

Paulo Villa,5/5,"Marina Bay Sands was an unforgettable experience! The shopping mall is stunning spacious, clean, and filled with a great mix of luxury and high-street brands. It’s a beautiful place to stroll around, even if you’re just window shopping. We had a lovely meal at one of the restaurants inside, and the service was excellent all around.

Later, we went up to Spago Bar & Lounge, and that was definitely the highlight. The views from the top were absolutely incredible, and the atmosphere was so classy and relaxed. The staff at Spago were attentive and welcoming, which really made the experience special. I had an amazing time and would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting Singapore","a month ago on

G,1/5,"We were so excited to be staying at the Sand’s as we had heard so many good things about it.

We arrived at the hotel and went to check in. Maybe 3 reception stations were open with about 2-3 employees at each one. It felt like an airport check in.

After standing in line for around 10minutes we were told to go to a back room to check in. The lady who checked us in was incredibly unfriendly. If she smiled it would have cracked her face.

Room was very nice but small. View was great until you looked down to the ground and they were doing construction. They don’t tell you this when you check in to a room with the garden view.

We were told our bags would arrive within 15-20min after checking in. After 30min I called front desk and I was told they were on the way up. 30min after that call luggage never arrived. I then called again and told them I was coming down to reception to collect the bags.

They once again told me the bags are on the way up. 10min later the bags arrived.

We headed up to the observation deck and it was like stepping foot into a disaster camp. As soon as you exit the elevator staff with cameras try and con you to take photos for money. This was really irritating and they blocked the entire walk way to the outer deck.

You had people sleeping all over the chairs and deck floor. There was even people having picnics with food out on the deck. So tacky.

Went and asked for information at the desk and again a stone cold faced women barely spoke to us.

For the price they charge and the service they provide it is not worth it. Staff are rude and the place is like an airport terminal.","2 weeks ago on

M B,3/5,Overrated hotel. Booked a 90sq m suite and everything felt cramped. Asked front desk and they said the 90m included the balcony and walls 😂 The ceilings are very low. Felt claustrophobic inside. One of the TVs was not working. The hotel is also very crowded and filled with rude Chinese tourists (not hotels fault).  The infinity pool on the roof was packed and dirty. The service was exceptional though but unfortunately it did not make up for the hotels shortcomings. Disappointed by the overall experience and will not stay here again in the future. The Singapore Edition was a better experience and I recommend people to try that instead of this.,"Edited a month ago on

There are few restaurants at the roof top but they are usually booked and require reservations.

May Young,5/5,"This experience stands out as one of the most unforgettable and exceptional hotel stays I have had the privilege of enjoying.
Marina Bay is unquestionably the hub of modern Singapore, featuring a stunning skyline that is especially dazzling at night when the city lights majestically reflect off the bay. The area is meticulously managed, ensuring flawless cleanliness, safety, and organization, rendering it perfect for leisurely strolls or romantic evenings. Notable attractions include the Marina Bay Sands SkyPark, which offers panoramic views, the Spectra Light & Water Show, and the Gardens by the Bay, particularly the Supertree Grove. The surrounding area also boasts outstanding dining options, ranging from street food to fine dining with remarkable views. The hotel's architectural design, especially the infinity pool, is genuinely impressive and breathtaking!😊","a month ago on

fang li,2/5,"I had a very disappointing dining experience at the restaurant on the 55th floor of this supposedly “luxury” hotel.

I was invited to dinner by a friend who was staying in one of the VIP suites. The restaurant is not open to the public and is exclusively for hotel guests, which made the experience feel even more exclusive—until the service completely ruined it.

Shortly after we began our meal, a staff member informed us that the dining time was limited to 90 minutes. That seemed fine at first. However, well before the 90 minutes were up, we were rushed by the same staff to finish our meal. I politely asked if we could have a little more time, as we were still eating slowly, and I noticed that two other tables who arrived before us were still enjoying their meals as well.

Eventually, they agreed to extend our time by 30 minutes and sent another staff member to apologize. I then asked again, “Isn’t the restaurant open until a certain time? Can guests eat until closing?” The person who came to apologize said, “Yes, you can stay and dine until the end.” So why was I being pushed out before our time was even up?

What shocked me the most was the attitude of the first staff member—it felt cold and unwelcoming, as if we were not entitled to be there. Was it because we weren’t the registered guests, but just friends of a VIP guest? If so, that kind of discriminatory service is completely unacceptable in a hotel of this standard.

The environment and view were wonderful, but the service left a sour taste. Dining should be about hospitality and respect, and unfortunately, this experience had neither. I hope management takes this feedback seriously—this is not the level of service one expects a high-end establishment。","a month ago on

Eitan Elul,5/5,"Marina Bay Sands is one of those places you have to experience at least once in Singapore — it’s more than just a hotel, it’s an icon. The views from the rooftop are legendary, but here’s the insider tip: instead of paying for a full-day pass, make a reservation at one of the rooftop bars or restaurants. That way, you get the same incredible skyline without overspending. Sometimes staff will let you walk around after dining, but it’s not guaranteed — so booking a drink or meal is the safest bet.

The food here is truly exceptional. From high-end restaurants to casual bites, everything feels curated, and you don’t have to break the bank if you plan wisely. Downstairs, the Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands mall is stunning — a mix of luxury brands, unique boutiques, and even a canal with gondola rides. Don’t miss the wine and whisky collection store; it’s like walking into a museum of rare bottles.

At night, the free Spectra light and water show at 8:00 and 9:00 PM outside the mall is a must-see — a dazzling blend of fountains, lasers, and music against the backdrop of the bay. Inside the hotel, the architecture itself is an experience: the world’s largest rooftop infinity pool (hotel guests only), soaring lobbies, and restaurants that rival any luxury destination.

Fun facts:
•	Marina Bay Sands opened in 2010 and cost around $5.5 billion USD to build.
•	The rooftop SkyPark spans all three towers and could fit four and a half A380 planes end to end.
•	The infinity pool is the longest elevated pool in the world at 150m.

Tip: Book a restaurant in advance for sunset, explore the mall before or after, and stay for the evening light show. It’s one of the few luxury experiences where you control how much you spend — and it’s worth every minute.","3 weeks ago on

At night, the free Spectra light and water show at 8:00 and 9:00 PM outside the mall is a must-see — a dazzling blend of fountains, lasers, and music against the backdrop of the bay. Inside the hotel, the architecture itself is an experience: the world’s largest rooftop infinity pool (hotel guests only), soaring lobbies, and restaurants that rival any luxury destination.

Fun facts:
•	Marina Bay Sands opened in 2010 and cost around $5.5 billion USD to build.
•	The rooftop SkyPark spans all three towers and could fit four and a half A380 planes end to end.
•	The infinity pool is the longest elevated pool in the world at 150m.

Tip: Book a restaurant in advance for sunset, explore the mall before or after, and stay for the evening light show. It’s one of the few luxury experiences where you control how much you spend — and it’s worth every minute."
Mich,5/5,"My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights for our honeymoon, alsoeet, and it was an unforgettable experience! The front desk staff, Simon and Jenny, were incredibly warm and welcoming. They gave us excellent service and were very thoughtful—they noticed it was my wife's birthday and that we were on our honeymoon, and even surprised us with a special honeymoon dessert!

The room was  spacious, spotless and very comfortable. Housekeeping did an amazing job every day, paying close attention to detail.

We were also lucky to catch Singapore’s 60th National Day fireworks during our stay. Watching the fireworks from the rooftop pool was one of the happiest and most unforgettable moments of our trip! Everything was perfect. This is truly a top-notch luxury resort.","a month ago on

Ricobald,5/5,"We stayed at the MBS for 2 nights. It was an unforgettable experience: the rooms are very spacious and clean, with the beds being absolutely perfect. Of course, the infinity pool was the highlight for the whole family, but so were the light shows in the Garden and the Bay. The quick check-out was perfect since we had little time on the day of departure. Unfortunately, on the day of arrival, only one of the two booked rooms was ready, which is not ideal after a 14-hour flight when all you want to do is rest. But overall, the hotel is definitely worth the trip!","Edited a month ago on

Staying at Marina Bay Sands was truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience that exceeded every expectation I had. From the moment I walked into the grand lobby, I could already feel that this was not just a hotel, but a world-class destination in itself. The scale, the design, and the atmosphere are breathtaking. Everything is built with such attention to detail that you immediately know you’re in one of the most iconic hotels in the world.

The highlight, of course, is the infinity pool at the SkyPark. I’ve seen it countless times in photos and videos, but being there in person is something else entirely. Swimming at the edge while overlooking the Singapore skyline is surreal—it feels like floating above the entire city. Day or night, the view is spectacular. In the morning, you get the calm and fresh energy of the city waking up, and at night, you’re treated to a dazzling skyline with lights that make the entire experience magical. It’s easily the most unforgettable pool I’ve ever been to.

The rooms are spacious, modern, and luxuriously comfortable. Floor-to-ceiling windows give you an unbeatable view, whether it’s the Gardens by the Bay or the city skyline. The beds are so comfortable that it’s almost difficult to get up in the morning—except you know you don’t want to waste any time staying in when you’re in such an amazing place. The bathroom amenities are top-notch, and everything feels meticulously maintained and spotless.

Dining at Marina Bay Sands is also an experience of its own. The selection of restaurants is phenomenal, from celebrity chef restaurants to local-inspired cuisine, ensuring there’s something for everyone. Every meal feels like part of the luxury experience, with flavors that are memorable and presentation that’s on point. The staff across all the restaurants are highly professional, attentive, and genuinely welcoming.

What makes Marina Bay Sands stand out even more is the service. Every staff member I interacted with—from reception, concierge, housekeeping, to the restaurants—was friendly, helpful, and professional. They really go the extra mile to make guests feel taken care of, which is the hallmark of true 5-star hospitality.

Beyond being a hotel, Marina Bay Sands is practically a city within a city. The integrated resort has luxury shopping, the ArtScience Museum, theaters, and direct access to Gardens by the Bay, making it incredibly convenient to explore. The location is unbeatable, with everything you need either within the resort or just a short walk away.

Overall, Marina Bay Sands is not just a hotel stay—it’s an experience. It’s luxurious, iconic, and unforgettable in every sense. Whether you’re traveling for leisure, business, or a special occasion, this place leaves a lasting impression that you’ll treasure for a lifetime. If you want to experience the best of Singapore, there’s no better place than Marina Bay Sands. Absolutely worth every dollar, and I can’t wait to come back again.","2 weeks ago on

**Inspire one
🌟 ""Not every dream fades when you wake up.""**

Last night, I had a dream.

I was surrounded by warmth and wonders—a world where everything felt possible.

The most fascinating part? I was at Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Tower 3, on a high floor. Standing by the edge of infinity, I gazed at a horizon that seemed to stretch forever.

When I woke up, I realized something amazing.

The dream stayed with me.

It reminded me how moments of awe can bring clarity and spark new ideas. Our surroundings play such an important role in shaping our emotions, thoughts, and even our dreams. And sometimes, those dreams gently nudge us to aim higher, to explore further, and to truly embrace the wonder around us.

I woke up inspired.

And now, I’m curious:
Have you ever had a dream or experience so vivid it stayed with you, even after you woke up?

Phuong Thu Vu,5/5,"A Review of the Sands Premier Suite at Marina Bay Sands
If you’re looking for a rejuvenating, luxurious holiday then you should definitely consider a stay at the prestigious Marina Bay Sands hotel!
Recently, me and my family had an amazing experience staying in the Sands Premier Suite of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. From the moment we arrived at the hotel, the staff were very helpful and polite. They immediately helped us with our luggages which made me felt very welcome.
The entire hotel, from the ceiling to the walls are designed with lots of thoughts in mind. Because we arrived way earlier than the check-in time, they arranged a temporary key so we could enjoy the infinity pool while waiting. From the infinity pool, you could see the whole skyline of Singapore. The water temperature is just cool enough to make you feel relaxed but warm enough so that you won’t have a hard time getting out.
After lunch, we came back to check-in and receive our room keys. They had 3 check-in counters, the “normal” one, the VIP one and the Paiza & Limosine one (which is like the Super VIP one). Because the “normal” check in counter was way too long, we got escorted to the Paiza & Limosine to check in. The receptionist there are very kind and quick, she got us our room in less than 5 minutes. Even though I booked the Sands Premier Studio, we got upgraded to the Sands Premier Suite (for free!).
The room was much bigger than a standard hotel room, with a separate living area that had a comfortable sofa and a large TV. The bedroom was also spacious and the bed was one of the most comfortable I’ve ever slept in. I really liked the floor-to-ceiling windows, which offered a stunning view of either the city skyline or the Gardens by the Bay. I chose the city view, and it was breathtaking, especially at night.
The bathroom was very modern and felt like a spa. It had a big bathtub for two people, which was a nice touch. They also provided very nice toiletries from Jo Malone. The room also had a walk-in wardrobe, which was very useful for keeping the room tidy and getting ready.
In conclusion, I would highly recommend the Sands Premier Suite. It’s a very luxurious option that offers excellent comfort, great amenities, and beautiful views. While it is quite expensive, the experience is worth it if you are looking for a special treat.","2 weeks ago on

Shane McLean,5/5,"Marina Bay Sands is, without a doubt, one of the most spectacular hotel experiences I’ve ever had. From the moment you walk into the grand lobby, you’re immersed in luxury, elegance, and impeccable service.

The infinity pool on the 57th floor is every bit as iconic as it looks in the photos—floating above the city skyline, it offers jaw-dropping panoramic views of Singapore. Watching the sunrise from the pool with a coffee in hand was pure magic.

My room was spacious, sleek, and sophisticated, with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking either the bay or the city. Every detail felt premium—from the plush bedding to the advanced tech and luxurious bathroom amenities.

Dining at Marina Bay Sands is a culinary journey. I had the pleasure of enjoying a world-class dinner at one of the celebrity chef restaurants and also loved the more casual options throughout the property. The buffet breakfast alone is worth writing home about—an incredible spread that caters to every taste.

The hotel is also in the perfect location—connected to high-end shops, the ArtScience Museum, and just steps from Gardens by the Bay. Whether you want to shop, sightsee, or just unwind in style, everything you need is right there.

It’s definitely a luxury stay with a luxury price tag, but in my opinion, it’s absolutely worth it for the once-in-a-lifetime experience. Marina Bay Sands isn’t just a hotel—it’s a destination.","4 months ago on

gilang fathur,5/5,"Got nothing to do during night in Singapore? Try marina bay!

It's a really really good place to enjoy the evening and experience the night life in Singapore. Take a walk around the marina bay and seeing all the crowds and lights are really hyping you up.
The skyline is also amazing here, you can spend the night just chilling watching the skyline or seeing what the crowds are up to, sometimes there's a performance from dance groups all over the city there.

One thing that you shouldn't miss is definitely the spektra light show. It's an amazing light show with water and laser projectors creating an amazing show that runs about 10-15 minutes. A perfect night with family or partner","a month ago on

Madhuram Sabari,5/5,"Didn’t get a chance to stay at Marina Bay Sands, but just seeing it from the outside was a stunning experience. The architecture is iconic and instantly recognizable — it truly dominates the Singapore skyline in the most elegant way.

The way the SkyPark spans across the three towers is incredible to see up close. At night, the building comes alive with beautiful lights and reflections on the bay. The surrounding area is also lively with great views, walkways, and photo spots.

Even without staying inside, it’s a landmark worth visiting — a must-see when in Singapore.","a month ago on

Rosanne Woodcraft,5/5,"From the moment you step into Marina Bay Sands, you’re wrapped in pure luxury. Every detail is meticulously thought out — from the grand lobby with its sweeping architecture to the impeccable service that anticipates your every need. The rooms are elegant and spacious, with breathtaking views of the city skyline or the bay, and the plush beds make it hard to leave.

The iconic infinity pool alone is worth the stay — floating at the top of the world with Singapore stretched out before you feels like a dream. The restaurants are world-class, offering everything from fine dining to global cuisines, all served with precision and flair.

Whether you're shopping in the high-end boutiques, relaxing at the spa, or simply soaking in the beauty of the design, Marina Bay Sands doesn’t miss a beat. It’s more than just a hotel — it’s an experience in flawless luxury and stunning attention to detail. Absolutely gorgeous from top to bottom.","2 months ago on

Deshani Bandara,5/5,"Marina Bay Sands Mall is truly a world-class shopping experience. From the moment you step in, the architecture grabs your attention  tall glass ceilings, polished marble floors, and a layout that blends elegance with ease. It feels more like walking through a luxury art gallery than a mall.

The range of shops is impressive from global designer labels like Louis Vuitton and Gucci to fine watch boutiques,handbags and jewelry stores. If you want to treat your self with luxury brands ,this is the place.

One of the best parts for me was the canal inside the mall, where you can take a gondola ride a lovely touch if you want something different. The waterfall feature in the middle adds to the charm.

The food options are diverse: from high end restaurants to casual bites and a food court downstairs with local and international cuisines.

The location is ideal too connected to Marina Bay Sands hotel, ArtScience Museum, and just a walk away from the Gardens by the Bay and the Spectra Light Show.","a month ago on

I have only had good times here and always look forward to coming back.

John SCN,5/5,"This is a review of MBS Hotel’s newly launched Aperitif Hour at 6 different restaurants based at MBS
————————————————————————-
In Jun 2025, MBS launched the Aperitif Hour ( 5pm-7pm ) at 6 restaurants based at MBS hotel and mall. This replaces the Evening Canapés ( which was available only at MBS hotel ).

The Aperitif Hour ( 5pm-7pm ), plus Breakfast ( 6.30am-10am ) and afternoon tea ( 3pm-5pm ) are made available FOC to guests staying in certain room types.

In the past 5 weeks, I have tried 5 of the restaurants that participated in the Aperitif Hour. Of the 5 restaurants, I tried 2 of them twice, because they are just so good.

My reviews, in descending order of ranking , are as follows :-

1.Bread Street Kitchen ( BSK )
———————————————-
I tried BSK twice over 5 weeks.
Of all the Aperitif Hour participating restaurants, this is the BEST ! 👍👍👍

Even though it was only 5pm, the restaurant has a busy and vibrant feel, with courteous staff attending to the needs of diners, who are happily chatting away. This is a happy place 😀😀😀.

Being a Gordon Ramsay restaurant, the food is, of course, very good. I am very happy that they served their in-house focaccia bread ( with humus ) first, before the arrival of our main orders of Sunday Roast Yorkies, Mini Fish & Chips, and Wagyu Burger Sliders. The delicious focaccia and humus makes the wait for the main orders so much bearable 😜.

Even though it is supposed to be Aperitif Hour, the food BSK served is of such a good size that we skipped dinner thereafter.

The Wagyu Burger Sliders are so good, that we ordered it both times we are there. ( My dining companion thinks it can give Cut’s Wagyu Sliders a run for their money, but I have to, ahem, differ lah 😅 ).

Even though we did not order any alcoholic beverages ( it’s part of the package ), I note they have a wide selection for connoisseurs. The non-alcoholic Ginger De Pooh, and Belini Junior are refreshingly good.

I will return to BSK for Aperitif Hour or a main meal during my next stay at MBS. 😋😋😋

2.Wakuda
—————-
I also tried Wakuda twice over 5 weeks.

Wakuda has an understated and quiet elegance. At 5pm, it’s not crowded or busy ( unlike BSK ), and I think many diners may like Wakuda exactly for that.

Being a sister restaurant to Waku Ghin, its food is very good. I have dined there many times, so having Aperitif Hour at Wakuda allows me to have a different experience there.

I really like their Wagyu Cigar, which is yummy 😋. Their Karage Chicken is extra crispy and delicious .

Wakuda is a really good restaurant.
I will definitely return for a sumptuous dinner with close friends and family… soon.

3.Koma
————-
When I am served with the food , I am blown away by their presentation… it came on a mini version of their iconic bridge ( which is the backdrop of countless photos of many diners there ). What a nice touch. 👍

We had the Aperitif Hour at the Bar Lounge instead of the main dining area. The wagyu slider is very good but the portions are relatively small.

I look forward to return to Koma for a main meal again.

4.Yardbird
——————
The quality of the food is good, and the portions are big enough that I skipped dinner thereafter.

I am surprised by the quality and spread of the food at Yardbird, which I have never visited before. I may now visit Yardbird in the near future.
At 5pm, the restaurant is relativity quiet.

5.Maison Boulud
—————————
When I arrived at 5pm, the service staff  assigned me a seat near a window which is scorching hot from the afternoon sun.

The food portions are very small and the quality average.

The restaurant itself is very quiet, with only 2 staff serving customers at 5pm.

The newly introduced Aperitif Hour is a brilliant idea !!!

This gives the hotel guests a chance to try the excellent food served by the restaurants based at the mall and hotel. Also, it provides the restaurants some business during the quiet hour of 5pm-6pm. A win-win-win for all. 👍👍👍

I look forward to Aperitif Hour being introduced at Cut, Spago, Black Tap etc. 😀😀😀","2 months ago on

Michael Mayer,5/5,"This hotel is perfect. Check in couldn’t have been more helpful. We were given and upgrade as it was my birthday along and as we were just staying one night and had a late flight the next day we were offered a replacement keycard for the next day to access the facilities as well as a bookable shower room so we could freshen up before heading to the airport.

The room was not huge but was so comfortable and well appointed. The bathroom was gorgeous and everything felt fresh and brand new. The tech worked well including wireless charging on the night stands, auto opening curtains and the largest tv I have ever seen in a hotel room.

We had a great view of the city but immediately changed to try out the infinity pool which is better than I could have ever imagined. The staff are kind but some of the servers could do with a little more training as quite a few mistakes were made. Food and drinks came from nearby Wolfgang Puck Spago and even simple things such as a Caesar salad or burger were really excellent.

It is open 6am until midnight and we went three times to visit. Don’t forget the hot tubs on the other side of the pool deck.

The hotel itself is absolutely huge and has a large number of restaurants within it, also a massive shopping mall, nightclub and casino. It is a city within a city.

It is also close to Gardens on the Bay and a walkway goes through the hotel towards it. But you can’t access the walkway from the hotel and have to exit the hotel and take a small lift and then walk back into the hotel at walkway level. A small detail.

The location is not great for the city but there is a metro stop nearby and of course it is perfect for all the attractions around the Marina Bay. One day was not enough. I can’t wait to go back.","2 months ago on

Eugenie,2/5,"Went to access this hotel while on my recent Singapore stay.
I didn't stay at the hotel, so am not offering a critique of the rooms/suites.
At 11.45-12pm, the lobby/foyer was insanely busy, there were hundreds of people checking in/out or hanging around.  Only black taxis( the expensive ones) were around and the valet and doormen were over whelmed. When I was leaving the cost for the black taxi to go to the airport was insane.
Overall, the crowd put me off immediately to even consider staying at this hotel.
There are so many instructions on how to get around the hotel, and which lifts to use.
I chose to have lunch at the foyer restaurant, as it's seafood buffet had been suggested to me. The restaurant is nice and the staff wonderful. The selection in the multi cuisine buffet stations is excellent, unfortunately with the exception of the seafood station. Prawns, lobster, crayfish, scallops arrive frozen from origin, then thawed and place on ice. All these were soggy, tasteless and chewy. I would avoid these.
The Sushi/Sashimi station is excellent.
The food in rest of the stations was also excellent.
I visited the pool, which was again very crowded. I don't care how good a view a pool has, the crowd here was intolerable.
The top level restaurants and bars have a lovely view, so lunch or dinner would be a nice experience.","2 months ago on

Wayne w,5/5,"An absolute pleasure to stay here for a few nights.  It is expensive, but for a treat I think it is well worth it.  My only complaint is that when asking them to arrange a taxi, they will book an unmetered taxi for you which is far more expensive than a metered taxi, so rather book your own metered taxi than use their more expensive option.  Everything else is above and beyond expectations.","2 months ago on

DR KESAVAN DHANAPAL,4/5,"Our visit to Marina Bay Sands was a memorable one, especially the experience of going to the top and witnessing the spectacular views of Singapore’s skyline. The coordination by the staff was commendable. Although we initially faced a small issue with our ticket not scanning properly, the team handled it with genuine warmth and professionalism. They reassured us not to worry, quickly sorted out the problem, and welcomed us with a friendly smile, which really set the tone for a great experience.

Once we reached the top, the view was undeniably impressive—stretching across iconic landmarks like the Singapore Flyer, Gardens by the Bay, and the endless expanse of city and sea. Everything was immaculately maintained, from the observation deck to the common areas. Cleanliness and upkeep clearly seem to be a top priority here.

That said, there are a few areas where the experience could be elevated further. Tourists today look for more interactive and immersive elements. Simple additions—like informative or engaging video displays inside the lifts (similar to what Burj Khalifa offers)—can really enhance the journey upward. Even having touch-screen installations at the top showcasing the history or stories of the buildings in view could add value.

Also, visiting during the daytime can be quite uncomfortable due to the harsh sun and heat. Some shaded or misted zones, or even cooling stations, would allow visitors to enjoy their time without feeling the need to rush through it.

Overall, Marina Bay Sands offers an iconic view, with a great team on the ground—but with just a few tweaks, it could offer a more memorable and comfortable experience for all.","a month ago on

Simon Liang,5/5,"This was the highlight of my Singapore trip in early 2024.
Marina Bay Sands truly earns every single star of its 5 star rating.
The rooms are spacious, spotless & the main lobby is huge.
The service is top notch. We only stayed there for 1 night as it's quite expensive & I'm usually quite a budget conscious person, so I don't usually stay at 5 star hotels, but the MBS hotel service is second to none. After getting there, we were immediately offered assistance with our luggage by staff, which was brought upstairs for us. The check in & check out process is seamless & straight-forward.
I'm not a gambler, so I didn't go to the casino, but I do like to keep my fitness up whilst I'm away, so I do recommend their gym. It is a fair walk from the rooms, but the variety of equipment was fantastic & it's a 24 hour gym too.
Obviously, you also can't go past the Infinity Pool whilst you're at MBS. Just remember to take your hotel key card with you when you go up.
Overall, despite the high price tag, I do recommend MBS if you do stay in Singapore, even if it's just for 1 night.","a month ago on

Lin Frank,2/5,"I stayed at Marina Bay Sands from July 3rd for five days and four nights with my family. Unfortunately, it was a disappointing experience.

On the first day, we waited for two full hours during check-in because the hotel said our room had a smoke odor. As compensation, we were given USD 150.

However, on the second night, we noticed the room still had a strong smell of smoke. The manager brought in a machine, saying it used a “natural solution” to remove the odor. I told them this was unacceptable—we have a child, and we couldn’t tolerate this for the rest of our holiday. I requested a room change or an upgrade, but the manager only said they would report it and then completely ignored us afterward.

This is the second time this year we’ve stayed here as a family, but sadly, it will be the last. A hotel of this level should take better care of its guests.","2 months ago on

StoryMiles,5/5,"Marina Bay Sands is truly one of Singapore’s most iconic landmarks and an experience in itself. The hotel offers stunning views of the skyline and the bay, especially from the infinity pool which is unlike anything else in the world. The rooms are spacious, modern, and very well maintained, with excellent service from the staff. The location is perfect—directly connected to high-end shopping, the ArtScience Museum, Gardens by the Bay, and the MRT.

The rooftop SkyPark is a must-visit, whether you are staying here or not, as it gives you panoramic views of the entire city. Prices are definitely on the higher side, but for a once-in-a-lifetime luxury experience in Singapore, it’s absolutely worth it.","Edited 3 weeks ago on

Ain Zin,5/5,"Booked a staycation for my parents birthdays and anniversary this August. We were warmly greeted by the hotel staffs upon arrival, and a heartfelt compliment goes to Tiffany Tan who was the concierge staff that attended to us and settled our check-in. We were pleasantly surprised when Tiffany had offered a room upgrade to celebrate the occasion if we don’t mind waiting a bit longer to get the room ready. Whilst waiting she offered temporary guest cards so they have access to the observation deck and pool which was much nicer than waiting at the lobby. On top of that, we also found a delicious chocolate cake in the room! My parents were beyond delighted by this sweet gesture, and I can’t thank Tiffany enough for being so attentive in making this absolutely memorable for them. The room was of course immaculate, the view stunning and the experience exceeded expectations. They enjoyed their stay and will definitely be back! Thank you once again to the amazing team at MBS.","3 weeks ago on

Francesco,3/5,"The design and architecture of Marina Bay Danza are truly impressive – the property is visually stunning and very well thought out in terms of style. Unfortunately, the overall experience does not match the beauty of the place.

Service is consistently poor, with little attention to guest needs and very limited customer care. The room amenities are disappointing for a property of this level, making the stay far less comfortable than expected.

The pool area looks beautiful at first glance, but quickly becomes a letdown. There are no sunshades provided, the sunbeds are placed extremely close to each other with no sense of privacy, and once again the service around the pool is lacking.

In short, while Marina Bay Danza scores highly for design and atmosphere, it falls short in almost every other aspect that makes a stay in a 5 star hotel.","a month ago on

Santhosh from housekeeping quickly sent up items when we needed them. The Express Service team from the call centre was super helpful and responsive throughout our stay.
We stayed in one of the newly renovated rooms, and it was fantastic—the suite featured a curated design, spotless finishes, and upscale smart tech. It came with a Dyson hairdryer in the closet, an automated smart toilet (it opens the lid as you approach!), and wireless charging pads built right within the tabletop. The room was absolutely spotless and super comfortable.

The best birthday ever! My amazing boyfriend, Donkey, surprised me with a stay at the luxurious MBS Hotel Suites, and the entire experience was pure bliss! From the moment we arrived, we were enveloped in an atmosphere of unparalleled elegance and sophistication. The suite itself was breathtaking & spacious, impeccably designed, and boasting floor to ceiling windows offering stunning panoramic views of the city skyline and Gardens by the Bay. The plush furnishings, state of the art amenities (I especially loved the deep-soaking tub!), and the sheer opulence of the space created an unforgettable experience. Simply relaxing and enjoying the breathtaking views was pure bliss. The service was generally impeccable, the staff were friendly, attentive, and always ready to assist with a smile. Dining at one of the hotel's many exceptional restaurants was a highlight, and the Sands Skypark infinity pool provided an unforgettable backdrop for a celebratory swim.  The only minor drawback was a slight delay in room service, we requested shower gel via the in-room TV system and waited approximately 45 minutes before having to call directly to expedite the request. However, this small inconvenience was easily overshadowed by the overall magnificence of our stay. Overall, the MBS Hotel Suites delivered an extraordinary experience, making it the most memorable birthday celebration ever.

Marina Bay is truly the heart of modern Singapore. The skyline is absolutely breathtaking, especially at night when the city lights reflect beautifully off the bay. The entire area is impeccably clean, safe, and well-organized—perfect for a relaxing stroll or a romantic evening.

Highlights for me included the Marina Bay Sands SkyPark with its stunning panoramic views, the Spectra Light & Water Show, and the Gardens by the Bay, especially the Supertree Grove. There's also fantastic dining nearby, from street food to fine restaurants with amazing views.

Kim Tey,5/5,"Iconic and Luxurious Experience!

Marina Bay Sands is an absolute gem in Singapore! The hotel, the infinity pool, and the observation deck – everything is top-notch. The view from the SkyPark is breathtaking, especially at sunset or night when the whole city lights up. The infinity pool on the 57th floor? Totally worth the hype – you feel like you're swimming in the sky.

The shopping mall downstairs is full of high-end brands, and the dining options are fantastic – perfect if you’re looking for something a bit fancy. The whole complex feels so luxurious and is a great spot to take photos.

Even if you're not staying at the hotel, visiting the observation deck or enjoying the rooftop is a must-do when in Singapore.","3 months ago on

Michael Mokaya Rasugu,5/5,Visited the  shopping mall & 57th Floor SPAGO Restaurant. Amazing views from the top! The SPAGO Rooftop restaurant in the middle Tower 2 isn’t all that in views and service. The panoramic view is blocked off for in-house residents who use the pool and the service can be quite slow during peak times. Still had a great time though!

Tarun Yadav,5/5,"I stayed here in a suite for 3 nights, 21st June-24th June; family of 5. We all thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. Staff was helpful and efficient - both at check-in and accommodating of a 75year old disabled grandmother. Only mild complaint was some of the quality of the food at RISE for buffets - there is a lot of options, but a lot of it isnt world class that you'd expect. Other mild complaint is gym. It's a good 5-10 min walk away near the expo centre - while all the cardio equipment is new, the gym is TINY. If you go at peak times, you have to wait for dumbbells etc. Otherwise, all in all, it is a luxury hotel with great dining options and entertainment in a great location. RECOMMEND.","2 months ago on

Pulok Reberio,5/5,"Marina Bay Sands is not just a hotel — it's an experience.

From the moment you walk into the grand lobby, you're treated to luxury, modern elegance, and world-class service. The iconic three-tower structure connected by the SkyPark is an architectural marvel and a symbol of Singapore itself.

🌟 Highlights:

✅ Infinity Pool – The rooftop infinity pool on the 57th floor is everything it’s hyped up to be. The view of Singapore’s skyline while floating in the pool is unforgettable and perfect for photos. (Note: pool access is for hotel guests only.)

✅ Location – Perfectly located at Marina Bay with direct access to Gardens by the Bay, the ArtScience Museum, and The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands. Everything is walkable or connected via MRT.

✅ Rooms – Spacious, clean, and luxuriously comfortable. Floor-to-ceiling windows offer stunning city or bay views. Bathrooms are high-end and well-stocked.

✅ Dining – From celebrity chef restaurants (Gordon Ramsay, Wolfgang Puck, etc.) to food courts and local cuisine, there’s something for every palate and budget.

✅ Shopping & Entertainment – Endless luxury shopping, live shows, the casino, and even Sampan rides indoors! It's impossible to be bored.

✅ Staff & Service – Professional, friendly, and attentive. Check-in and check-out are smooth even when the hotel is busy.","2 months ago on

Eddie B.,5/5,"Saved up my pennies to stay at MBS, stayed 4 nights and  it didnt disappoint.  An average room is 4 figures per night.  It does come with a lot of perks and you pay for convenience

Walking distance to many of Singapores iconic locations and plenty to keep the family busy

A convenient casino just steps away

The convention center across the street

Doraemon,5/5,"To celebrate Kitty's birthday, I treated us to a suite at the iconic Marina Bay Sands, and it was an absolutely unforgettable experience. Knowing the suite was a significant investment, we decided to maximize our time indulging in the luxurious amenities and breathtaking views from our room. While we did venture out, we primarily focused on enjoying the comfort and elegance of our suite, interspersed with a special dinner at the Paiza Sky Residence.

The suite itself was incredibly spacious and elegantly appointed, offering stunning panoramic views of the city skyline and Marina Bay. Kitty particularly loved the sheer size of the room, commenting on how much space there was to relax and unwind. The luxurious bedding and amenities were top-notch, but what truly impressed her was the luxurious bathroom. The enormous bathtub with a built-in jacuzzi was a standout feature, and the in-built bathroom TV added an extra touch of luxury.  She spent a considerable amount of time luxuriating in the tub, enjoying the jets and the in-bathroom entertainment.  We also made use of the in-room karaoke system (KTV), enjoying a fun and relaxing night of singing.

Our dinner at the Paiza Sky Residence was, without a doubt, a highlight. The service was impeccable, the food exquisite, and the ambience sophisticated and elegant. The panoramic views from the Sky Residence were equally stunning, offering a different perspective on the city skyline compared to our suite.

Even the little details were impressive. Kitty particularly enjoyed the high-quality toiletries provided. The  body lotion, hair shampoo, and conditioner all smelled divine. The complimentary drinks and fresh fruit in the room were a welcome touch. Everything was immaculately clean and seamlessly arranged, adding to the overall luxurious experience.

While we did briefly explore The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands and the SkyPark Observation Deck having a short swin at the infinity pool, the majority of our stay was spent luxuriating in our suite and enjoying the exceptional dining experience at the Sky Residence. It was a splurge, but for a special occasion like Kitty's birthday, it was absolutely worth it.","2 months ago on

However, an impressive architectural wonder is nothing without the famous Singaporean hospitality, which you see on Singapore Airlines. Even though we arrived at the hotel by Uber, we were treated like royalty by the greet staff and thus continued throughout our stay

My wife has wanted to swim in the rooftop pool here since seeing it on the Crazy Rich Asians movie. Only guests are allowed to use the pool, so an extra shift at work paid for our stay

It reminds me of the giant Vegas mega hotels with massive corridors, high end shopping and a casino. You won’t run out of of things to do with many other attractions on your doorstep. Don’t miss the free dancing fountains show","a month ago on

Thang Nguyen,5/5,"If you’re visiting Singapore and looking for an unforgettable experience, Marina Bay Sands is the place to be. From the moment you step inside, it’s clear why this hotel is one of the most iconic landmarks in the world.

The architecture alone is a marvel — three soaring towers connected by the breathtaking SkyPark, which offers panoramic views of the city skyline and Marina Bay. The infinity pool on the rooftop is perhaps the most famous in the world, and swimming there feels like floating above the city.

Rooms are spacious, modern, and impeccably maintained, with floor-to-ceiling windows that bring the stunning skyline right into your suite. The service is top-tier, blending warmth and professionalism in true Singaporean fashion.

What makes Marina Bay Sands truly unique is its integration with luxury retail, entertainment, and dining. The hotel is connected to a high-end shopping mall featuring the most prestigious brands globally — Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Dior, and more — along with a curated selection of fine dining from celebrity chefs like Gordon Ramsay and Wolfgang Puck.

The casino, ArtScience Museum, and regular light shows at the Spectra waterfront add even more dimension to your stay, whether you’re here for business or leisure","a month ago on

Andrew Germanos,5/5,"Marina Bay Sands is one of the most iconic and breathtaking destinations in Singapore — a true architectural marvel that lives up to the hype. The moment you arrive, you're struck by how clean, modern, and well-maintained the entire area is. It’s obvious the government has invested heavily in making this part of the city not only efficient but also visually stunning.

The complex itself has everything: a luxury hotel, a massive shopping mall, world-class restaurants, the ArtScience Museum, a casino, and the famous SkyPark Infinity Pool with panoramic views of the city skyline. At night, the entire bay lights up beautifully, creating an unforgettable atmosphere. The nightly light and water shows are truly a spectacle, adding to the area’s magical charm.

Marina Bay Sands is also very tourist-friendly. Once you’ve walked around a bit or used the MRT nearby, getting your bearings becomes easy. The area feels safe, accessible, and full of energy.

We were incredibly lucky to visit while Singapore was preparing for its 60th National Day celebrations. We witnessed military rehearsals, fighter jets soaring overhead, and stunning fireworks lighting up the bay. Combined with the elegance of Marina Bay Sands, it made for a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

Highly recommended for any visitor to Singapore.

Zoei Zhang,5/5,"Went there a couple of days ago for the fireworks display during the NDP rehearsals. It was so well organised despite being super crowded.

I drove there via the south parking entrance and we were directed to park our cars in the expo hall/loading bay. They opened all the expo halls and converted it into a massive carpark instead 😆 the staff members allocated spaces to each car so the process was very quick and efficient.

After the fireworks display, to facilitate human traffic and to maintain safety, they closed some doors in the middle of the mall so that people don’t rush in from all directions from outdoors to indoors and have to follow the same direction for exiting.","a month ago on

Alex Y.N.A,1/5,"Thanks guys. You guys don’t even take care of your workers- a relative of mine who has been working for your company as a cleaner for almost 8 years has just been told by his supervisor that because he’s “sick” which he isn’t, he was told he had no job when he turned up to work, and not even given a formal letter of termination. He was told that he would be contacted by HR on Monday which is astonishing. We’ve contacted your front desk and from what we’ve been told, HR is on it but we don’t know when we’ll be called. We have contacted MOM about this because the situation is beyond unfair- this is a man who’s elderly and who is getting his eye fixed. He’s not blind or sick. This smacks of unfair termination, and his supervisor should’ve gone through the right channels and or tried to help him. He knows that his only issue is his diabetes which doesn’t make him ill. Well, we hope that the Hr will get back as soon as possible. Either way, we have contacted MOM about this unfair treatment and we hope that this issue can be solved soon. Imagine doing this to an elderly person who has worked hard for your company for ages, is always early and makes sure he’s on time. This is awful.","3 months ago on

He was told that he would be contacted by HR on Monday which is astonishing. We’ve contacted your front desk and from what we’ve been told, HR is on it but we don’t know when we’ll be called. We have contacted MOM about this because the situation is beyond unfair- this is a man who’s elderly and who is getting his eye fixed. He’s not blind or sick. This smacks of unfair termination, and his supervisor should’ve gone through the right channels and or tried to help him. He knows that his only issue is his diabetes which doesn’t make him ill. Well, we hope that the Hr will get back as soon as possible. Either way, we have contacted MOM about this unfair treatment and we hope that this issue can be solved soon. Imagine doing this to an elderly person who has worked hard for your company for ages, is always early and makes sure he’s on time. This is awful."

Jie Bo Ti,5/5,"Perhaps my favourite memory of this place was having a nice afternoon tea with my mother on the 55th floor. We were overlooking the city skyline and she was pointed out the changes to the Singaporean skyline.
You could tell how proud she was and how proud LKY and the pioneer generation must be to see the progress they've made.
MBS really do hold a special place in the mind if every Singaporean above a certain age. Because once there was nothing, something extraordinary came in its place.","2 months ago on

Phineas Flynn,5/5,"Marina Bay Sands is without a doubt one of the most iconic landmarks in Singapore, offering a luxurious experience from start to finish. The architecture alone is breathtaking—three towers connected by the famous SkyPark, which offers stunning panoramic views of the city skyline, Marina Bay, and beyond.

The Infinity Pool on the rooftop is world-famous and truly lives up to the hype. It’s only accessible to hotel guests, but if you get the chance to stay, it’s worth it for that view alone. There’s also a public observation deck if you're not staying at the hotel.

Inside, MBS features a high-end shopping mall with luxury brands, a canal with gondola rides, and a wide variety of restaurants—from celebrity chef fine dining to local delicacies. The ArtScience Museum and nightly Spectra light and water show at the promenade are great additions that make it a complete entertainment destination.

It’s directly connected to Gardens by the Bay via a beautiful pedestrian bridge, and the Bayfront MRT station is just below the complex, making it super accessible.

Whether you're staying the night, coming for a show, or just enjoying the views, Marina Bay Sands offers a world-class experience in the heart of Singapore.","2 months ago on

Md. Raisul Islam,4/5,"Marina Bay Sands in Singapore is a landmark that has become synonymous with luxury and innovation since its opening in 2011. Located on the waterfront of Marina Bay, the resort features an iconic design with three interconnected towers, topped by the Sands SkyPark, which boasts the world’s largest infinity pool. This rooftop area offers stunning panoramic views of Singapore’s skyline, creating a unique experience for hotel guests.

The resort offers 1,850 rooms and suites, ranging from elegant Premier Rooms to the ultra-luxurious Paiza Collection. The rooms are designed with modern sophistication, featuring plush furnishings, marble bathrooms, and the latest in-room technology. Guests staying in the Paiza Collection enjoy exclusive benefits, including butler service, private lounge access, and enhanced privileges at the SkyPark.

Marina Bay Sands is also home to an impressive selection of dining options, with over 80 restaurants and bars. Renowned chefs like Wolfgang Puck, Gordon Ramsay, and Tetsuya Wakuda have established eateries here, offering a variety of world-class culinary experiences. The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands, an upscale shopping mall, features more than 300 luxury stores, while the ArtScience Museum offers an intriguing mix of exhibitions that combine art, science, and technology.

Entertainment options at the resort are abundant. The light and water show, Spectra, is a nightly spectacle, and the MARQUEE nightclub adds to the vibrant nightlife scene. The casino, along with a theater hosting international performances and a large convention center, ensures that there’s always something to do. For those looking for relaxation, the Banyan Tree Spa provides a range of luxurious treatments, and the fitness center is equipped with state-of-the-art facilities.

One downside to consider is the resort’s sheer size, which can lead to crowded public areas, especially during peak seasons. Guests have occasionally mentioned longer wait times for certain amenities. Despite this, the vast array of services and the exceptional level of service offered at Marina Bay Sands often outweigh these inconveniences.

Marina Bay Sands is a top-tier destination for travelers seeking a luxurious all-in-one resort experience. Whether you’re enjoying the infinity pool, dining at world-class restaurants, shopping, or indulging in the entertainment, the resort offers something for everyone, making it a standout choice when visiting Singapore.","4 weeks ago on

Thanawat Silanon,5/5,"The most luxurious shopping mall I’ve ever been to. It includes the world’s first floating Apple Store and the world’s first Louis Vuitton Island Maison.

Easily accessible via Bayfront MRT station, the mall is huge, extremely clean, and well-maintained.

The signage in the mall is clear and easy to understand, making it simple to find your way around. There are many tourists, yet it doesn’t feel crowded because of how spacious the mall is.

The mall also has clean and modern restrooms and well-planned escalators for easy movement between floors.

It features a luxury hotel and was deemed the world’s most expensive standalone casino property in 2010 — though I didn’t have the chance to experience those myself.

Overall, it’s an impressive and unique shopping destination that combines luxury, convenience, and thoughtful design — definitely worth a visit even if you’re just exploring.","3 months ago on

Dave,3/5,"Outside of the casino is great, but if you want to gamble (and drink alcohol) I would recommend the short mrt/monorail ride to Resorts world casino.
For some reason they make it very difficult to obtain a beer (served in a warm plastic mug, no open bar so you need to find a service person) and they will tell you about a Singaporean law saying you need to wait 30mins at least before you order another. This law I did not see anywhere else in Singapore so the slow service does seem on purpose. Very crowded too.","3 months ago on

Mario Botakis,4/5,"Excellent location, best part personally was the shower head, I know weird but true, followed by the view from the room. Rooftop pool is amazing, can get very windy up there, worst part might be the check in reception area, it's not formal at all and seriously for the money you'd think they would provide a private reception instead of a chaotic environment because of foot traffic. Shopping and food are top notch, gardens by the bay and supertrees very close by. Definitely recommend the hotel as it was an overall a great experience.","6 months ago on

shahzain mustafa,5/5,"Marina Bay Sands isn’t just a hotel—it's an icon that defines the Singapore skyline and an immersive experience in luxury, architecture, and entertainment. From the moment you enter, you're surrounded by a sense of scale and grandeur that few hotels in the world can match. The triple-tower structure, connected at the top by the SkyPark, feels futuristic yet harmoniously integrated with the Marina Bay waterfront.

I stayed in a Premier Room on a high floor, and the view from the floor-to-ceiling windows was absolutely unforgettable—overlooking Gardens by the Bay and the Singapore Strait. The room itself was luxurious yet understated, with thoughtful design touches, a spacious bathroom with a rain shower, and everything you’d expect from a world-class 5-star property.

Of course, the highlight was the infinity pool. It's reserved for hotel guests only and lives up to every bit of hype. Watching the city skyline glow at dusk while swimming 57 stories up was something I’ll remember forever. The SkyPark observation deck, accessible to the public for a fee, is also fantastic for views and photos.

Dining was equally stellar—LAVO had one of the best Italian meals I’ve had in Asia, and breakfast at Rise was generous, varied, and well-executed. The integrated shopping mall downstairs (The Shoppes) has everything from Louis Vuitton to artisanal coffee shops. You’ll also find the ArtScience Museum here, with its lotus-like design and rotating exhibitions.

Yes, it’s expensive. But for what you’re getting—the architecture, the views, the facilities, the sheer wow-factor—it’s one of those places worth splurging on at least once. Tip: Book early and request a higher floor with a pool-facing view","2 months ago on

We got there, told we needed to book, they were full and couldn't fit us in.
There was some tension for 5 or so mins while my brother explained what we were told by customer service. Anyway they were going to get us a table. A minimum of $30 a head spend. Cheapest cocktail $20 and cheapest dish $20.

Julie Kay Hoyle,4/5,"It was a surreal experience, which was good. It is expensive to dine within the hotel at various venues. Drinks were very expensive too. A buffet breakfast was included, but oh my goodness, it was extremely busy no matter what time we attended. One day, there were over 70 people in the queue waiting to be seated. We sent an email to the hotel, as one day, our allocated table was next to a door for anyone to go outside into the garden dining area. This particular breakfast wasn't enjoyable as it was a constant thoroughfare with so many other guests squeezing past. We received a phone call within a few minutes of sending our email. They understood our issue but didn't offer any solution. We weren't offered this table again 🙏 The said table was still in place the following day! We also sadly noticed the huge amount of food being wasted from a lot of guests.
We had a couple of issues having to wait, one was for some wine we had ordered for our room, we eventually after almost an hour of waiting received a call to advise the wine wasn't available!
The room itself was lovely & the views were beautiful. Overall the staff were extremely polite & very helpful.
The main thoroughfare near to reception is extremely busy, with anyone being able to access not just guests staying at the hotel as the shopping mall/cinema/casino/restaurants, etc, are accessible from here.
We do hope the infrastructure is being carefully considered whilst Tower 4 is being constructed, as the number of people moving through & around is extremely busy!!

The service is very good and the staff is attentive to your needs.
It's conveniently located in the center of the city and walking distance to the main attractions, such as the gardens and Merlion, as well as the singing fountain and the shopping mall.
The only downside is that the hotel used to have a sauna and steam room, but it is no longer available.

Pro tip, book in advance at a restaurant or bar on L57 so you can enjoy the million dollar views, along with the establishments observation deck (which is) often private and for patrons only.

Skypark observatory seems to have massive queues (and) for slightly more than you’d pay for the fee (you) can enjoy a beautiful experience instead.","7 months ago on

Helen Lee,5/5,"I really enjoyed my stay at Marina Bay Sands. We stayed one night only to experience the pool. I was concerned that the pool would be crowded but it wasn’t. The view at the top is truly amazing. I stayed there on a Tuesday in October. I got upgraded to a bayside suite room in Tower 3 in a newly renovated room and was able to watch the light show at the Gardens by the Bay which happens twice a night. The service was amazing and despite being such a big hotel, I did not feel lost or without attention. There is also a laser light show at the marina bay sands complex at night which was fun. Get there early to secure good seats. The area is fun to walk around or jog. There is also a mall attached and a casino. (Did not go so can’t comment)","11 months ago on

Marius,5/5,"For such a massive mega-hotel, the Marina Bay Sands executes quite flawlessly.  The room was beautiful and has some of the most impressive latest technology and the service is truly quite amazing.  And of course  - the rooftop infinity pool is one of a kind in this world.

We were fortunate enough to stay at the room facing Gardens by the bay with a large walk-out balcony. While the room was quite small, it was jam-packed with all kinds of tech features that even blow the Japanese hotels away.

The  service was absolutely remarkable. Any need was fulfilled within 10 mins or less from the call, and the staff truly cared about ones comfort.

The breakfast had the ""quantity over quality"" feel to it. As to be expected,  the spread was quite massive, with quite massive crowds to boot. Best to go before 08:30am to avoid any lines.

Of course, the rooftop infinity pool is a 10/10. Incredible in every way, a true modern marvel. We visited several times through several days and even at night and found plenty of loungers available. Staff was there to provide quick drink and snack service as well.

Overall , I was left impressed with the MBS. The room was impeccably clean and showed zero signs of wear. Its quite impressive how such a large enterprise can keep the service level so high. And the service was amazing, but one does feel a bit like a number based on the size of the hotel. Would definitely stay here again.","7 months ago on

Tai Chen,5/5,"A seaside hotel that captures the imagination often blends natural beauty with human-centric design, creating an immersive escape from the mundane. Here’s a multidimensional portrayal of an ideal coastal retreat:

**1. Symbiosis with the Ocean**
- **Boundless Vistas**: Perched atop a crescent-shaped bay, every suite features 270-degree floor-to-ceiling windows. The tides become a living mural, while the ""Golden Hour of the Sea"" during dawn and dusk offers a private visual feast.
- **Exclusive Shoreline**: A private 800-meter white sand beach pairs with a tidal monitoring system that alerts guests to optimal tide-pooling times. Guided explorations reveal hidden intertidal ecosystems at low tide.

**2. Architectural Poetry**
- **Cultural Reverence**: Inspired by traditional fishing village dwellings, the terraced structure boasts a façade embedded with millions of recycled seashells, their undulating textures shimmering like sunlit waves.
- **Liquid Aesthetics**: The lobby dazzles with 3,000 hand-blown glass jellyfish lamps. Ocean breezes animate the space, casting rippling shadows that transform check-in into an aquatic overture.

**3. Sensory Sanctuary**
- **Smart Ambiance**: Beds auto-adjust to body contours, while voice-controlled systems cycle through soundscapes like ""coral reef white noise"" or ""dolphin frequency."" Mineral-seaweed aromas diffuse via circadian-rhythm scent systems.
- **Marine Interaction**: Balconies house underwater periscopes; UV night mode unveils bioluminescent plankton. A cabin journal logs daily sightings of rare marine species.

**4. Reimagined Ocean Experiences**
- **Tidal Gastronomy**: A 18-course ""Marine Evolution"" tasting menu evolves with daily catches. Glass-floored dining platforms frame schools of fish darting beneath diners’ feet.
- **Abyssal Meditation**: Collaborating with oceanographers, transparent submersible pods host singing bowl sessions at 20-meter depths, where humpback whale songs resonate through the hull.

**5. Sustainable Innovation**
- Tidal energy meets 60% of power needs; greywater nourishes vertical algae walls that filter CO₂.
- The ""Coral Adoption Program"" lets guests plant reefs for carbon credits, redeemable for eco-experiences like nocturnal squid tagging.

More than a hotel, it’s a portal to marine consciousness—when bare feet touch moon-warmed sands and smart tidal bracelets pulse to signal a bioluminescent bloom, worldly identities dissolve with the receding tide, leaving only the true self in whispered dialogue with the eternal sea.","Edited 5 months ago on

Tushar Shah,4/5,For a World Class Hotel I feel it was only worthy of four stars. I have stayed in hotels of this level and found them to be worthy of 5 stars. For MBS I felt more could be done towards the guests. For example the Rise restaurant where you have your breakfast and hight teas just seem basic. The food offered as part of the booking (buffet style) is more likely to be the left overs from A La Carte menu on the other side of the restaurant. I suppose it's food served that is not going to waste!,"6 months ago on

The architecture itself is breathtaking, and the views from the SkyPark Observation Deck are absolutely stunning—especially at sunset when the city skyline lights up. The infinity pool at the top is world-famous, and for good reason, offering one of the most unique swimming experiences in the world.

Inside, Marina Bay Sands offers everything under one roof: a luxury shopping mall with high-end brands, a wide range of restaurants (from celebrity chefs to casual dining), a casino, and even a museum. The Spectra light and water show at night by the bay is a highlight not to be missed—free and beautifully choreographed.

Manoj T W,5/5,"Marina Bay Sands is one of Singapore’s most iconic landmarks and a symbol of modern architectural brilliance. The complex consists of three towering hotel blocks connected at the top by the SkyPark, an engineering marvel that offers panoramic views of the city skyline and Marina Bay.

One of the biggest draws is the world-famous infinity pool, located on the rooftop. Reserved exclusively for hotel guests, the pool provides an unforgettable experience—floating above the city while enjoying spectacular views. Many visitors book at least one night’s stay just to access it, and while prices can be high, booking during off-peak periods or through special promotions can help you save significantly.

Beyond the pool, the resort is home to a large shopping mall, a casino, and a wide variety of dining options ranging from food court fare to high-end restaurants by celebrity chefs. The quality of food across the property is consistently excellent.

What makes Marina Bay Sands truly special is its dual perspective: you can enjoy stunning views of both the futuristic Gardens by the Bay and the dazzling city skyline, especially at night when the lights come alive.

Whether you’re staying overnight, dining, or just visiting the observation deck, it’s an experience that’s absolutely worth having at least once in your lifetime.","Edited 4 months ago on

Ras U-Ahk,5/5,"Marina Bay Sands Singapore truly exceeded my expectations during my short stay. The iconic property boasts breathtaking landscapes that immediately transport you to a world of luxury and elegance. While my visit was brief, I was able to immerse myself in the grandeur that Marina Bay Sands is renowned for.

Upon arrival, I regretfully missed the opportunity to dine at their Italian restaurant due to its closing hours. Nevertheless, I was compensated by the exceptional service and warm hospitality extended by the staff, making me feel welcome and valued throughout my stay.

One highlight of my visit was the casino experience, even though I am not a gambling enthusiast. Watching my friend revel in the excitement of the baccarat table was a joy in itself. The refreshing lemonade cucumber tea served at the casino instantly became a favorite, earning the amusing moniker ""hot mountain dew"" from us.

While exploring the expansive mall area, I marveled at the architecture and design surrounding me. The sheer scale of the mall was impressive, filled with an array of stores and amenities that cater to every need and desire. Although I missed the chance to fully indulge in retail therapy due to the late hour, the ambiance alone was enough to leave a lasting impression.

Despite the closing time of most establishments in the mall, we found solace in dining at the exclusive club restaurant. The culinary experience was nothing short of exceptional, offering a delectable array of dishes that tantalized our taste buds and left us craving for more. The impeccable service and attention to detail truly elevated our dining experience to a new level of luxury.

One cannot help but appreciate the intricate beauty and craftsmanship that permeates every corner of Marina Bay Sands. From the lavish decor to the stunning views of the surrounding cityscape, every aspect of the property exudes sophistication and opulence. The meticulous attention to detail is evident in every aspect of the hotel, ensuring a seamless and unforgettable experience for every guest.

The unparalleled views from the observation deck left me in awe of the panoramic vistas that stretched as far as the eye could see. The expansive skyline of Singapore, coupled with the stunning waterfront views, created a mesmerizing backdrop that encapsulated the essence of urban beauty and modernity.

Throughout my stay, I was consistently impressed by the level of service and professionalism displayed by the staff at Marina Bay Sands. Their dedication to ensuring the comfort and satisfaction of guests was commendable, making me feel valued and appreciated at every interaction.

In conclusion, Marina Bay Sands Singapore is a true gem that offers a luxurious and immersive experience like no other. From the exquisite landscapes to the world-class amenities and exceptional service, every aspect of the property is designed to exceed expectations and create lasting memories. My short but unforgettable stay at Marina Bay Sands has left me eager to return and indulge in all the wonders this iconic destination has to offer.","7 months ago on 
Google",Google,2025-09-21 20:50:17,en,"Marina Bay Sands Singapore truly exceeded my expectations during my short stay. The iconic property boasts breathtaking landscapes that immediately transport you to a world of luxury and elegance. While my visit was brief, I was able to immerse myself in the grandeur that Marina Bay Sands is renowned for.

Upon arrival, I regretfully missed the opportunity to dine at their Italian restaurant due to its closing hours. Nevertheless, I was compensated by the exceptional service and warm hospitality extended by the staff, making me feel welcome and valued throughout my stay.

One highlight of my visit was the casino experience, even though I am not a gambling enthusiast. Watching my friend revel in the excitement of the baccarat table was a joy in itself. The refreshing lemonade cucumber tea served at the casino instantly became a favorite, earning the amusing moniker ""hot mountain dew"" from us.

Shubham Prasad,5/5,"An Iconic Luxury Experience

Marina Bay Sands is nothing short of spectacular. From the moment you arrive, you’re enveloped in luxury and grandeur. The architecture is iconic, and the view from the SkyPark is absolutely breathtaking, offering panoramic vistas of Singapore’s skyline that are worth the visit alone.

The rooms are spacious, modern, and well-appointed, with many offering stunning views of the bay. The infinity pool is the star attraction—swimming at the top of the world is an experience that you simply can’t miss. It’s a bit crowded at times, but the view and atmosphere make it worth it.

Beyond the rooms and pool, the complex has everything you could need—high-end shopping, world-class dining, and a casino. The staff are attentive and ensure your stay is as comfortable as possible.

Marina Bay Sands isn’t just a hotel; it’s a destination in itself. Whether you’re staying here or just visiting, it’s an experience that defines luxury in Singapore. Highly recommended for anyone looking to indulge in the best the city has to offer.

After exploring the mall, we took a leisurely walk through the surrounding areas, which offered stunning views of the city skyline.

Fernanda Ferreira,5/5,"Not only a hotel but a whole mall and restaurants hub. The three towers are super impressive also from inside, the elevators are fast and not crowded. Recommend booking your table in advance if you plan to dine at any restaurant at the top floors to avoid queuing. We had dinner at Ce la Vie and that gave us access to the club as well, the view to the city is amazing from the 57 floor. Everyone is super nice and friendly","a year ago on

This was my second stay at Marina Bay Sands, and it’s now my absolute favorite! I opted for a suite room overlooking the breathtaking Gardens by the Bay, and it truly took my experience to the next level. The suite itself was exquisitely detailed, every inch of the room designed to perfection. From the plush bedding to the sleek bathroom and high-end amenities, the attention to quality was second to none.

The views were beyond spectacular, and it felt like the gardens were an extension of the suite, creating a serene and unforgettable atmosphere. But what truly made my stay exceptional was the staff. They were incredibly attentive, friendly, and went above and beyond to make sure my stay was perfect. Nothing was too much for them—each request was met with a genuine smile and impeccable service.

I would recommend going up at night though as once the light show finishes, it does thin out and it was a pleasurable experience.","9 months ago on

Only issue was the mass confusion of how to exit the venue after the fireworks. Entries and exits were locked and couldn't find a way out to the street.  0,000s of people were cramming to enter the MTR.

Fluked finding the underground carpark, still not knowing how to exit the venue.  If not for a generous local, who had parked there, offering to drive me home, I'd probably be stuck there for hours!! With all the locked entries/exits that night, I'm concerned as to how they would have evacuated visitors had there been a fire.","Edited 7 months ago on

L Lim,5/5,"I was very impressed by the room when I first stepped in and the quality of the toiletries was top notch. Mini bar was stocked and fully free. Sorry no alcohol though. 75” TV in a twin  sharing room? Unheard of but it’s staring me in the face. Beds were firm and comfy, pillows were at the right firmness, ensuring. Perfect night sleep. We stayed on the 28th floor and the view of the sea was amazing. The infinity pool is a must try even though you don’t swim. Overall a 5 star stay. Worth every penny I paid!","a year ago on

Wendy Peskett,5/5,"There was a £30 minimum spend per person to go to for the view.

You can choose to sit on the pool view side or sea view. I get that the best places need to be reserved for guests that's right... But it would have been nice to step out to take a better photo of the views.

It as lovely to see the decorations for Xmas.

The cocktails and mocktails were fairly expensive, but tasted fantastic. Shame that there were no alcohol free gins available as mocktails with these taste good and are popular.

Staff were helpful and friendly. One troll loads of photos for our group to make sure we got the perfect shot.

Desserts were fabulous. Especially the kulfi in 2 flavours.","10 months ago on

Firoz khan Mewati,5/5,"Marina Bay Sands is nothing short of spectacular. From the moment I stepped in, I was struck by the luxury and attention to detail in every corner of this iconic hotel.the highlight, of course, is the infinity pool.

Dining at Marina Bay Sands was also a treat. With a range of world-class restaurants and cafes, there’s something for everyone. I tried a few options within the complex, and each meal was delicious, albeit a bit pricey (which is expected given the location).

The hotel is perfectly located for exploring the city—just a short walk or ride away from major attractions like Gardens by the Bay, the ArtScience Museum, and the Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands. The convenience and experience were well worth it.","10 months ago on

The staff is very kind and efficient since they have an outrageous number of people coming to stay or visit each day. The rooms are lovely with good views no matter where you are. The pool is also incredible! Staff is friendly there as well though reasonably strict about only allowing guests through (do NOT lose your room key!). The biggest downside is that it is truly flooded with people. The lobby, the restaurants, the bars, the pool, everything is crowded so it’s hard to fully appreciate the hotel and its amenities.","a year ago on

Eduard Matúš,5/5,"We stayed in Marina Bay Sands to celebrate our anniversary. The hotel staff was amazing and they went beyond our expectations to make our experience a very special one 🙏

The room was both beautiful and highly functional in ways that actually matter: High-end Audio, automated lights, curtains, HVAC all controllable from the TV.

Our stay in MBS by itself made the trip to Singapore totally worth it.

The location is perfect, views amazing and there's top notch shopping, dining and entertainment in the same building.

If there is one nit that I think can be improved on:
It would be amazing to offer a wider food menu for room service, or to offer in-room dining experiences from some of the high end restaurants in the MBS complex. Allowing guests to enjoy top notch dining in a top-notch room with top-notch views.

And I didn't even get to the insane infinity pool on top of the building 🙂

If you're thinking of booking one night, strongly consider booking two to have one full day without worrying about logistics.","10 months ago on

The only thing I would do differently next time is to select a room that faces the Garden by the Sea. The premier king we got faces the bay but is not high enough to get a good view.","a year ago on

William Wright,5/5,"The Sands Exposition Center and Mall is probably the most impressive mall that I have ever seen.  I don't know how much money it took to build this, but they thought of a lot.  First, they have the best food court that I have ever been to.  I've been here several times now and the prices are slightly higher, but the cuisine is really good with all booths.  It is like a high quality Hawker Center or something.  Plus, there is a Subway that goes right through the middle of it.  The Downtown line comes directly to this mall! Plus, in case you didn't know this already, you can actually walk on top of this mall!  There is an elevator to the top, and the view from here is amazing!  Not only that, but you can also walk directly to the Supertree Forest, via a special walkway which they have built between the two locations, saving you all kinds of time.  There is a lotus lake outside which almost nobody visits, which is a great place to enjoy some Tea or Coffee.  There is a casino here, and a lot more.  But you have got to see this place to believe it.","a year ago on

Mohit Singh,5/5,"We stayed 2 nights and had booked bay view room but during checkin process we got upgraded to executive room with city zviewing which due to lack of room that I had booked. The executive room was fab and appeared like bigger than 3 bed flat.  City view from room and lounge area was amazing. Room was on 45th floor. Hi Tech touch panel everywhere to control lights, curtains and AC. Fully automatic smart toilet with touch panel, what a luxury !! Jacuzzi, 12 point shower panel, 2 wash basin in bathroom and a tv in front of bath. Separate dressing area, dining area, bar area, lounge area with 6 seater sofa having 75 inch TV. It was fab. Only thing I didnt like was the big queue for breakfast. This hotel is super expensive and seeing guests standing in a long queue was no pleasure at all. Then, though we were upgraded to executive room but were denied breakfast since it wasnt part of my original booking but executive suits cones with by default breakfast. Its like getting upgraded to business class from economy class but cabin crew serving you food of economy class which is rare or I have never heard of. Singapore is heaven for food and we wanted to explore local food hence it wasnt an issue at all but this is something MBS management shoul look into and consider my airlones analogy. Infinity pool, observation deck was easily accessible.","10 months ago on

Towers are immaculate to walk through, the adjacent mall has one or more stores of almost all important designers. We only noticed Zimmermann who wasn't present.
Make sure to get their member card, if you plan on buying anything or eat at black tap burgers for example.

Their staff was extremely friendly, they even lined up our shoes and folded clothes that we threw on the couch. After using most of our complementary coffee capsules, they even gave us one more of each and plenty of sweets. Minibar is well stocked with a good variety of snacks, softdrinks and even a shaker to make your own cocktails. Even the size of the coffee was adjusted to match their cups.
Rooms are clean and of high quality interior. You can control all lighting, do not disturb and Ac from each side of your bed, which was a nice add on. When we left they put a number of glass cleaning clothes and even a cable organizer + amenities to take with us.

Probably the best city hotel I have ever stayed at. Definitely worth the money, don't look any further.

Kishore DK,5/5,"Marina Bay Sands in Singapore is an iconic luxury destination that offers a unique combination of world-class hospitality, stunning architecture, and exceptional experiences. Located in the heart of the city, it is renowned for its striking design, featuring three interconnected towers topped by the SkyPark, which provides panoramic views of the Singapore skyline.

The hotel boasts opulent rooms and suites with modern amenities, elegant furnishings, and floor-to-ceiling windows that showcase breathtaking city or sea views. The service is exemplary, with staff going above and beyond to ensure a seamless stay.

The highlight of Marina Bay Sands is undoubtedly the Infinity Pool on the SkyPark, which is the world’s largest rooftop pool. Floating on the edge of the pool while gazing at the cityscape is an unforgettable experience. The SkyPark also houses observation decks and restaurants offering gourmet dining, further elevating the luxury quotient.

For entertainment, Marina Bay Sands has something for everyone. The integrated resort includes a high-end shopping mall, an impressive casino, and the ArtScience Museum, which hosts cutting-edge exhibitions. The theater regularly features international performances, adding to the cultural allure.

While the experience is undoubtedly luxurious, it comes with a premium price tag. Some guests might find the property bustling, especially during peak tourist seasons. However, the overall ambiance, impeccable service, and unmatched facilities make it worth the splurge.

In conclusion, Marina Bay Sands is more than just a hotel—it’s a destination in itself, perfect for those seeking indulgence, entertainment, and iconic memories in Singapore.","Edited 9 months ago on

Kunal Taviya,5/5,"A Sky-High Experience with Spectacular Views

We visited hotel’s observation deck. This observation deck offers a panoramic view of the city that is truly breathtaking.

The primary draw of the Marina Bay Sands Observation Deck is, of course, the view. From this vantage point, you get an unobstructed, 360-degree view of Singapore’s stunning skyline, the bustling Marina Bay, and the vast expanse of the sea stretching into the distance. On a clear day, you can see as far as Indonesian lands.

The view encompasses some of Singapore’s most iconic landmarks. You’ll see the lush greenery and futuristic structures of Gardens by the Bay, including the Supertree Grove and the two glass conservatories. The sight of the Marina Bay area from above, including the Merlion, the Esplanade, and the Singapore Flyer, is particularly striking. As the sun sets, the city transitions into a vibrant display of lights, making the evening visit a magical experience. The colors reflecting off the bay and the dazzling city lights make it an ideal spot for photographers.

The Observation Deck itself is expansive, offering plenty of room to move around and take in the views from different angles. Unlike other observation decks that might feel cramped, this one provides ample space for everyone to enjoy the view without feeling crowded, even during peak hours. The deck is designed to ensure safety while providing an open, airy feel.

One of the unique aspects of the deck is its open-air design. Unlike enclosed observation decks with glass barriers, the Marina Bay Sands deck offers an unobstructed view, allowing you to fully immerse yourself in the surroundings. The feeling of standing 57 floors above ground, with the wind in your hair and the city sprawled out beneath you, is exhilarating.

To get the most out of your visit, I recommend timing your trip to coincide with sunset. Arriving about an hour before sunset allows you to experience the transition from day to night. Watching the sun dip below the horizon, casting a warm golden hue over the city, is a moment of pure beauty. As day turns to night, the city’s lights begin to sparkle, creating a mesmerizing scene that’s perfect for capturing on camera.

Another highlight of an evening visit is the nightly Spectra Light and Water Show at Marina Bay Sands. From the Observation Deck, you get a unique, bird’s-eye view of this show, which combines dancing fountains, colorful lights, and music in a spectacular display. The view from above adds an extra dimension to the experience, allowing you to appreciate the choreography of the water jets and lights in their entirety.

The Observation Deck also offers a few additional amenities that enhance the experience. There’s a small bar where you can purchase drinks and snacks, allowing you to relax and enjoy the view with a refreshing beverage in hand.

It’s worth noting that the open-air design means it can get quite hot during the day, so bringing sunscreen and a hat is advisable if you’re visiting earlier in the day.","Edited a year ago on

Dinesh,5/5,"My recent visit to Singapore was fab, and the highlight of this incredible journey was undeniably my stay at Marina Bay Sands. From the moment I set foot in this iconic hotel, I was spellbound by the sheer beauty of the bay area and the rich cultural experiences that surrounded me.

The first thing that left me in awe was the breathtaking view of the city skyline from the rooftop infinity pool. The sight of the glittering skyscrapers and the stunning Marina Bay was nothing short of magical, especially during the evening when the city lights up. I could have spent hours just soaking in this incredible panorama.

The Bay Area itself is a sight to behold. The calm waters of the bay, juxtaposed with the bustling cityscape, create a unique and captivating atmosphere. A leisurely stroll along the bay promenade allowed me to absorb the vibrant energy of this place and appreciate the blend of modernity and tradition that Singapore so perfectly encapsulates.

Overall, my visit to Marina Bay Sands in Singapore was nothing short of extraordinary. The hotel, the bay area, and the cultural experiences exceeded my expectations and made my first trip to Singapore a memorable one. If you're seeking a blend of luxury, culture, and breathtaking views, this is the place to be. I left with a heavy heart, but with memories I will cherish for a lifetime.","Edited a year ago on 
Google",Google,2025-09-21 21:01:26,en,"My recent visit to Singapore was fab, and the highlight of this incredible journey was undeniably my stay at Marina Bay Sands. From the moment I set foot in this iconic hotel, I was spellbound by the sheer beauty of the bay area and the rich cultural experiences that surrounded me.

The first thing that left me in awe was the breathtaking view of the city skyline from the rooftop infinity pool. The sight of the glittering skyscrapers and the stunning Marina Bay was nothing short of magical, especially during the evening when the city lights up.

Kevin Whitley,3/5,"Room was quite nice but the facility itself felt very convention-hall like. Like an older, semi-run-down grand hotel that was probably super nice a decade or two ago.

The rooftop pool was kinda cool, but not really worth the cost in our opinion.

Again, we did really think our room was great - with some really nice touches. Points there for sure!","a year ago on

Alaa Hafiz,5/5,"My recent stay at the iconic Marina Bay Sands in Singapore was nothing short of exceptional. From the moment I arrived, I was thoroughly impressed by the level of service and attention to detail that the resort provided.

One of the highlights of my stay was the unexpected room upgrade I received, which afforded me breathtaking views of the Singapore skyline and Marina Bay. Being able to wake up and enjoy the stunning vistas each morning was truly a treat. Swimming in the infinity pool was an experience I'll never forget.

What really sets Marina Bay Sands apart, though, was the exceptional level of service. The resort provided me with temporary cards that allowed me to access the swimming pool and reserve time slots for the shower facilities, even after I had checked out. This thoughtful touch ensured that I could continue to enjoy the resort's amenities on my final day, without any hassle.

I cannot recommend Marina Bay Sands highly enough. Whether you're visiting Singapore for business or leisure, this iconic resort offers an unparalleled blend of luxury, service, and unforgettable experiences. I left feeling refreshed, rejuvenated.","a year ago on

But currently 3 rd tower flors from 17to 35 is under construction. Noise from construction from 8-9am till 8 pm.

However it has amazing infinity pool , you can get there even if you check in early. It has shower rooms inside toilets. Bring your swimming suits with you while you wait for your room to get ready.

You also can get to the gardens by the bay from inside the hotel. Just need to walk out and go on the lift to get to the bridge.","a year ago on

Blue & Green Traveling Team,5/5,"Loved our stay here! On the expensive side, but decided to splurge for a two night stay after our cruise! Room was big and clean, however, it looked a bit tired with nicks and scratches on the furnishings! I expected being that it is a highly praised and visible hotel that everything would be on the luxurious side, but I have seen better. On the brighter side, the hotel is centrally located with all the highlights of what Singapore has to offer within walking distance. The hotel also boasts a high-end mall with food court. It does get extremely busy so plan accordingly if you'd like to get something to eat and to see any light shows, need to show up at least an hour before to get prime spot. Any the infinity pool was amazing overlooking the city! We went at 6 am in the morning for a swim and no one was around until about 6:30 am then the crowd started to build up.

Wei Liang Sim,3/5,"The rooms are nice. Service could be warmer, but they are very professional and efficient.

Go if you love gambling, probably the better of the 2 casinos. Alternatively, for the gram, there's the overcrowded pool.

So overall, I'd say a 3 star for value because you'll be facing not just the room costs but the dining is all generally priced at premium too.","a year ago on

Angela Edwards,5/5,"It was a fabulous  experience  from  check-in to check-out. Staff were friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable. We travelled as a family of adult children, and our room was upgraded for free! Both rooms had superb views over the supertree grove and glass houses so we could watch the light show from our balcony.  We got priority  access to the observation  deck and visited the pool twice. Loved the fact there  was an adult only area, too.
We didn't dine there, and the only issue  I have is the fact that everything  in Singapore  harbour area that's good gets booked far in advance.  We were warned about this the day before check-in and didn't  do anything about it. My advice would be to choose a restaurant  within the hotel as they are excellent (not like hotel food in the UK), and come highly  recommended  on Trip Advisor.

All in all, it was an amazing  experience.  Would love to come again someday, and I will sort out eateries before  we arrive!","2 years ago on

You are an experience that’s hard to match. It’s not just a pool; it’s a statement, a place where you feel like you’re floating above the city.

The service is top-notch across the board. The staff are attentive, professional, and genuinely eager to make your stay exceptional. From check-in to check-out, every interaction is smooth and pleasant, making you feel pampered at every step.

Avinash Yadav,5/5,"Marina Bay Sands is one of Singapore’s most iconic landmarks, a luxury hotel that is more than just a place to stay—it’s an experience in itself. During my recent visit, I was left in awe of its architectural grandeur, world-class amenities, and stunning views. Adding to this, my dining experience at LAVO Italian Restaurant & Rooftop Bar was a highlight of the trip, though there were some areas where it could have been better.

**Marina Bay Sands Experience:**

From the moment you arrive at Marina Bay Sands, the sheer scale of the place is impressive. The hotel consists of three massive towers connected by a SkyPark, which offers one of the best panoramic views of the city. Checking in was seamless despite the large number of guests, and the staff were attentive and professional throughout our stay.

The rooms were spacious, well-appointed, and offered floor-to-ceiling windows with breathtaking views of Singapore’s skyline or the bay. The attention to detail in the rooms, from the plush bedding to the luxurious bathrooms, made our stay incredibly comfortable. The location of Marina Bay Sands is also unbeatable—it’s situated near many of Singapore’s key attractions, such as Gardens by the Bay, the ArtScience Museum, and the Merlion, making it perfect for tourists looking to explore the city.

However, what sets Marina Bay Sands apart is its world-famous infinity pool located on the 57th floor. Floating in the pool while taking in the views of the city skyline is an experience you won’t forget. It’s worth noting that the pool area does get crowded, especially during peak hours, so it’s best to visit early in the morning or late in the evening for a more relaxed atmosphere.

For entertainment, Marina Bay Sands also boasts a world-class casino, high-end shopping at The Shoppes, and an array of restaurants, bars, and cafes. The hotel’s wide variety of dining options ensures there’s something for everyone, from casual eateries to fine dining.

**Dining at LAVO Restaurant:**

One of the dining highlights at Marina Bay Sands was our dinner at LAVO Italian Restaurant & Rooftop Bar. Situated on the 57th floor, LAVO offers stunning 360-degree views of Singapore’s skyline, and the ambiance is unbeatable. The warm lighting, plush seating, and open-air terrace create a sophisticated yet relaxed atmosphere. Whether you’re seated indoors or outdoors, you’re in for a visual treat.

LAVO’s menu is an impressive mix of Italian-American cuisine. We started with the *Fried Calamari* and *Meatball*, both of which were delicious. The calamari was perfectly crisp, and the meatball was tender and flavorful, served in a rich tomato sauce. For our main course, we ordered the *Spaghetti Carbonara* and *Lobster Ravioli*. The carbonara was creamy and flavorful, though slightly on the heavier side, while the lobster ravioli was a standout dish, with perfectly cooked pasta and generous portions of lobster.

However, as much as we enjoyed the food, the prices were on the higher side, which is to be expected given the prime location. The service, while friendly, could have been more attentive. It took longer than expected for our orders to be taken, and the food arrived slightly later than anticipated. While the ambiance and views made up for the slight delays, it’s something that could be improved for a more seamless dining experience.

The rooftop bar at LAVO is a must-visit for anyone looking to enjoy cocktails with a view. The drinks were well-crafted, and sipping a cocktail while watching the city lights come to life was a memorable experience.

**Conclusion:**

Marina Bay Sands is a premier destination in Singapore, offering a luxurious stay with unparalleled views, world-class amenities, and a range of dining options. The infinity pool alone makes it worth the visit, and its location is perfect for exploring Singapore. LAVO Restaurant, with its stunning views and delicious Italian-American cuisine, is a great dining spot, though a few tweaks in service would make it even better.

andy p,5/5,It’s Marina Bay Sands. It’s not cheap but you get what you pay for. Being able to swim in the infinity pool above Singapore is an incredible experience. We would go at 6am when then pool opened and we had it to ourselves. Incredible!,"a year ago on

Deepanshu Sharma,5/5,"Undoubtedly, one of the most recognized and popular attractions of Singapore, the Hotel is an icon in itself, and this place is currently one of the most popular destinations in Singapore.

The view from the top is amazing, and the deck is not rainproof but open, and there can be closures due to weather. The hotel is connected to a garden, mall, museum, and a lot of other attractions that are just a 5-7 minute walk away.","a year ago on

N B,5/5,"It’s a beautiful hotel but extremely busy and crowded in the lobby as it’s a must see destination.  Our room was in Tower 1 on the 14th floor and they were doing renovations above our room so the noise was sufficient enough that we requested a different room in a different tower but all the rooms were booked.  The manger was amazing, it blew my mind away! He helped us find another hotel and booked a room for us.  This was the best experience I’ve ever had in my life.  I would definitely recommend this hotel and would love to stay there in the future!!!","a year ago on

The Infinity Pool on the roof was, well the most standout of them all.  Pools were separated for the adults and kids section, so for all us adults could enjoy the views and food/drinks in peace and harmony without screaming and jumping kids.  All staff at all levels Inc pool staff were great, very friendly and professional. It was great to have direct access to the gardens by the bay and the shoppes at Marina Bay.

It was fine, in terms of the food and drinks on offer, but it was overcrowded and the staff, salary, didn't really offer a great service.

What a beautiful sunset it would have been I’m the evening especially from that height and view. Food there was also great, many varieties and also many different types of food. My sister also bought a jelly cat to play with, as her soft toy. A fun toy to play with indeed. Although expensive, food, goods and services are worthy the price. Would recommend staying there.","2 years ago on

Food- better than what we had everywhere else in the city but we didn't visit a lot of high end restaurants to compare. Ce La Vi is worth for the view! Make sure you have reservations.
Service - it is a hit or miss- at times you feel pampered and cared for, at times ignored.
Give yourself some time to eat from one place to another. The towers are quite massive and it takes some time to figure out and get from one point to the next. Definitely try the pool- an insta opportunity!

Unfortunately, when we were booking there were no more rooms left on higher floors,but when we came to check-in, they were kind enough to offer an upgrade on the 49. floor overlooking the city and it was spectacular. The pool is amazing, I did not think I would be that amazed but I was speechless once in it. The pool has a booking system of an hour and 15 minutes. We felt that it was very well organized by the whole staff considering the pandemic. At least it wasn't crowded at all. :) We tried the gym, too. It was nice, had decent equipment with a gorgeous view. All the staff was amazing. It was a perfect stay.","3 years ago on

- professional staff (for welcome, restaurant, room service, etc). Also did their best to accommodate us as soon as possible
- the rooms are excellent, great amenities and automations for everything, high tech
- the infinity pool, one of the best in the world: very high up in the sky with great views. Fruits refreshments throughout the day
- great and complete main restaurant, both breakfast and dinner buffets
- luxurious overall, like a mini mall with various stores and restaurants
- good location, various nearby attractions: Gardens by the Bay, Singapore Flyer, Spectra show, etc, nearby the MRT subway too

My advice: get a room with gardens by the bay view, both day and night the view is nice and calming, during the night you can also see the Gardens lights and music show. On the opposite side you have the city and the lake below, I personally prefer the Gardens view","a year ago on

Tanner T,5/5,"Hotel room is beautiful. One side faces the Garden by the Bay and sea with open balcony, the other side facing businesses district with night scenery. Room is clean and spacious but room rates on the high side though. It is worth it though.  Remember to book the Infinite pool ..

Shopping area are great as well with most luxury brands (LV, Prada, Dior, McQueen, YSL, Celine, Chanel, and others like Zara, Kenzo, etc)  has food court with varieties of internationl cuisine and couples with many restaurants as well.

Visit the Vortex waterfall, LV & Apple iconic buidlings.

No seating areas so only place to see down is at cafe, eateries outlets","a year ago on

Muhammed Mustafa,2/5,"Love the views but that’s all they are charging for. Quite frankly the infrastructure is really old and the rooms are quite basic. My room smelled like cigarettes which got me a headache, they put an air freshener but this is something I have never experienced in a 5 star.
The service of the hotel is not the best. I found the staff quite unfriendly and would not even greet their guests which I found odd. I mentioned to them in an email exchange that we will be staying for our anniversary and they said they will be sending a dessert over once we check in which they didn’t. Who even does that.
Overall I would not recommend it, there are many much better hotels in Singapore for the same price or even much cheaper.","a year ago on

János Dézsi,4/5,"The hotel is great in industrializing the 5-star experience. Do not attempt online checkin, because then your stuff won’t reach your room from the drop-off and there will be issues with the online deposit. This simply does not work as you would expect. The room is quite nice on higher floors, but they started some maintenance next to our room and as they left an emergency exit open and blocked the beeping noise was quite disturbing in our room during the night. We were offered a new room, but as we would had to move our staff the night before our checkout, it did not make any sense. We would have expected much more from such a high ranked hotel and considering these it does not worth the money. Maybe one time to check the pool. I never had to call or contact the front desk so often in any other hotel like here, and we are not picky at all. The service is nice and the staff is polite but not flexible at all. Mixing business people with people on vacation is also not a great idea.","a year ago on

Jonas Nørgaard,3/5,"We feel like all we do is wait at this hotel. We are checking in to the Orchid Suite today after a day in the Premier King room. We've been waiting 15 minutes in line to get a table for breakfast, no one had time to serve us at breakfast, and the food was not very good, we waited in line to check in, we waited in line to check out, the restaurant makes mistakes on the order at lunch. The check out-person told us we could keep our access to the first room while waiting for the suite to get ready, but our key cards stopped working so we had to spend another 30-40 minutes with the check in counter to get access to our luggage which was still in the old room. Finally, after spending $1,200 for a night in their suite we were asked to walk to an ATM to withdraw $2 for stamps so they could send two postcards for us. OK, thanks

It is evident that the service as a Premier Room customer is low. The service level as a Suite customer is much higher - use Club 55 as much as possible! The service at Club 55 lives up to our expectations and service at other great hotels and Club 55 together with the pool is what gives this hotel 3 out of 5 stars. This was a nice change after the first day. We have stayed at 7 hotels in the past 30 days, and even though the service level increased a lot after booking the suite, this hotel comes in at rank 6 out of 7 hotels (second last).

The top floor pool is amazing, though. Amazing views from the top! A must see!","Edited 3 years ago on

Best time to visit is evening around the sunset and then continue till Singapore lights are on, this way you can enjoy hot day and night views and it’s amazing beauty.

It is a must visit place in Singapore. A huge shopping mall with a Casino, multiple restaurants, luxury brands, etc available.

The outside area is just something else. A floating apple store, and a floating LV store, with an amazing view of high rise buildings and the city all lit up.

A light and sound fountain show happens Fri - Sun.

Sally Torgeson,5/5,"How do you describe perfect? Staff go 110% to make you feel welcome and will fulfill any request if not outrageous.
My room on the 44th floor overlooked the light garden.
Patrick, in the reception area was especially helpful in all aspects. I am a single elderly traveler and he was outstanding.
Best of all was the restaurants.  Blossom for quick dim sum but for something very special go to floor 57 Ca la Vie. 5*****.","a year ago on

Ishani Mehta,5/5,"We were concerned about the scale of the hotel and the number of guests and how that might impact our stay, but from even before reaching the hotel, we were so wonderfully assisted by a personalized check in staff as part of premier check-in services that we didn't need to worry about a thing. The luggage magically came to the room and left the room without us needing to supervise, thanks to the very able luggage staff and the exceptional operational management. It is worth staying in the suites for this premiere experience. Each dining option offered by the hotel is just fabulous, with the stunning views from Club 55, the beautifully crafted cakes and savouries at Renku, and especially the widespread and delicious breakfast selections at Rise. The ease with which the scale of operation at breakfast at Rise is managed is just remarkable. The swimming pool experience was also memorable, and we managed to go at times when the crowds were a little less. The suite itself was beautifully appointed, with all necessities placed in the correct position. The views were stunning..we were lucky to get a corner room for an Orchid suite, which offered both city and garden views with sunset and sunrise views. The large windows with mechanised curtains truly elevate the experience. The bathroom and all its amenities, including the selection of toiletries, was extremely premiere. And it is extremely easy to access the towers, the mall, and the various dining places due to the logical layout of the whole complex. The only thing thing that needs a bit of improvement is the elevator waiting time when exiting the sky deck. Overall, amazing stay and we will come back.","3 years ago on

Freddy,1/5,"The food court service and food standard at MBS managed by Koufu is worse than a hawker centre. Rasapura Masters is the name of this food court at MBS which is managed by the Koufu. This is not the first time we patronize this place and the latest incident really makes me feel pissed off and decided to leave a bad review for them. Firstly, we bought coffee and tea from them, the taste is so bland and diluted. Therefore i return back to the beverage counter asking for more condensed milk to be added. But to my surprise instead of condensed milk sugar was added instead? Is this the correct way to brew and serve a cup of coffee/tea which cost $2.20 to the customer and give substandard quality? We don't mind to pay extra but it is really not worth as hawker centre coffee is even better than them! And the food court executive is standing at the beverage order counter allowing all this to happen? Secondly, we bought ice kacang from the dessert counter and the portion and appearance is totally different from what is display on the signage. I feel cheated as this is not way to do business and it costs $4.30 for this kind of dessert? I approach the staff making the dessert and she rudely told me is like that one, the display is only a photo! Come on shouldn't you make the finished product to be almost the same as display or else this is actually considered as cheating customers. Example if i sell fishball noodles, my signage display is three fishball and some fishcake but the end product i cook out i only put one fishball into the noodles. Is it correct to do so? I don't think so! This foodcourt is simply a disgrace to the customers especially to the tourists and ruined Singapore food and beverages heritage which they represented at MBS...","Edited 8 months ago on

I was amazed because I was just getting the deluxe room and then they said they don't have any available and they upgraded our room into executive sweet for free!!! Good deal Marina Bay! Thank you! worth the stay! The staff is very friendly and nice. I ask for a match after 5 mins they delivered it. I like the place because it's just adjacent to the Mall and to the food court which has a cheaper food price. The infinity pool is amazing friendly staff. There is one time I forgot my wallet in the room and we were hungry at the infinity pool we ordered our food and they just charge my room no. and when we check out they just automatically deduct it to our deposit. Perfect place for a proposal facing the garden bay and the flower dome. Thank you, Marina Bay Sands, for the great experience!

Food was bad. Service staff were part timers. The most amazing and non compliant was the food plate that was served to customers were smelly and it was as though as rinsed and dried using oily water without soap. Both supervisors were made aware and all they could do was to apologies on behalf of housekeeping. We had raised the feedback to the event owner and no news were heard. The plates were really smelly reaks of Stench of sully water.

Despite raising it as food hygiene issues, all the supervisor did was apologies and scrambled to find clean plates. We didn't touch the last3 dishes due to the aftermath of bad smell and taste right on the table.

For the price you are charging, we expected more.

B Rai,5/5,"Stayed for a night. Amazing customer service from the moment we entered. Staff were pleasant and professional. Offered early check-in and high floor room (as it was our anniversary trip). The amenities in the hotel inc the infinity pool was vast and stunning. We loved the food court especially.
Thought check-out was at 12 but it was 11, but they kindly offered us an hour extension.
Would highly recommend experiencing a stay here.

Minor, the infinity pool could have been more heated, it was windy and chilly to get into at first.","2 years ago on

Mark Nelson,4/5,"Fun hotel, especially for the iconic rooftop infinity pool and proximity to botanical gardens.  It’s a very big casino hotel, so not the place for you if you are looking for charm.  The service was so-so, and we had a tough check in process at 2am.  It took an eternity and they didn’t have our two rooms anywhere near each other - even in separate towers.  It is also too big to give a feel for any sort of personal touch, but we knew that going in and it was fine.","3 years ago on

Nothing special in terms of service or anything exceptional that makes it stand out other than the building. Other 5 star hotels in Singapore are much better in terms of cleanliness and interior, and service. Felt the rooms were not as modern and up to date for the price. Sheets and pillow smelled, and had stains even after requesting it to be changed. Didn’t feel comfortable and clean staying here. Expected much more as we were so excited to stay here. It’s the place u stay once for the experience but probably will never go back.","2 years ago on

Adventure Factory,5/5,"This is one of the best hotels in Singapore located right in the middle of the action area. Everything is just a stone's throw away. There are a lot of shopping options if you are into indulgence. You can also explore nearby options quickly if you are staying here.

It has one of the best infinity pools which is located on the 57th floor and only accessible to hotel guests. The only issue is it would be crowded mostly and You can see a lot of guests clicking pictures and capturing the skyline. It gives one of the best views of the city and they have restaurants like Spago and Lavo right next to the pool which give quite a few and reasonable eating options as compared to the charges of the room.

Overall I would say that the room sizes could be better at the cost that is charged but then again you should be prepared for spending some money if you want to visit and stay in one of the most expensive hotels in one of the most expensive city 😜. Definitely a must go if you have the money to experience.","a year ago on

Vũ Hải Nam,5/5,"My trip to Marina Bay Sands was nothing short of spectacular, and I can't wait to share my experience with you. This iconic destination in Singapore is truly a marvel.

First off, the architecture is jaw-dropping. The three towering buildings connected by that massive rooftop deck, which includes the famous infinity pool, are a testament to human engineering at its finest. As soon as I arrived, I was in awe of the sheer scale and design of this place.

Now, let's talk about the shopping. The mall inside Marina Bay Sands is a shopper's paradise. You'll find all the high-end brands you can think of, and if you're a fan of luxury shopping, this is the place to be.

But the real star of the show is the view. From the rooftop deck, you get an unparalleled panoramic view of the Singapore skyline. I recommend going up there during sunset – the sight is simply breathtaking. And don't forget your camera because you'll want to capture every moment.

Now, onto the services. They are top-notch, just as you'd expect from such a renowned destination. The staff is incredibly friendly and always ready to assist with a smile. I felt well taken care of during my entire visit.

For those planning a visit, here are some tips. Aim to visit in the evening to catch the mesmerizing light show. Check the weather forecast because Singapore can surprise you with sudden rain. And budget accordingly, as Marina Bay Sands offers a plethora of experiences, and you'll want to make the most of your time here.

In terms of improvements, it's hard to find fault, but perhaps more affordable dining options could make the experience even more accessible to a wider range of visitors.

In conclusion, Marina Bay Sands is a must-visit destination in Singapore. It combines stunning architecture, world-class shopping, and breathtaking views into an unforgettable experience. So, if you find yourself in Singapore, make sure to put this gem on your itinerary – you won't be disappointed!","a year ago on

Dharshan Bapu,5/5,"This is a stunning hotel and will be landmark of Singapore for years to come. If you can afford to stay it’s a great one I believe, I couldn’t afford so we went in for the deck tour to get the superior view of Singapore from top. Guess it was more than 54 floor and deck is on top floor and went in by a high speed elevator, was not crowded when we went, the cost covers a digital photo and if you need a printed one it’s extra. The view from the deck is stunning and luckily when we went it was not that sunny, so could enjoy the view. The swimming pool is on other side and only residents are allowed and from the deck we can catch a glimpse. Please experience this view if you are in Singapore. Once we were done and got to the reception level we strolled the huge lobby which was decorated well for Christmas and had some snacks at the cafe /bakery there. Taste was awesome and you must try. From the entrance of the hotel where taxi dropped us for the deck tour the gardens by the bay is walkable which is another attraction you should not miss.","2 years ago on

Syaziera Hazriela,5/5,"Something special about this place is that it's an integrated resort notable for transforming Singapore's city skyline, it comprises three 55-storey towers of extravagant hotel rooms and luxury suites with personal butler services. The appearance of the Marina Bay resort is what makes it famous. The three huge towers are home to 2,500 hotel rooms and suites, joined together at the bottom by a seamless lobby area. What makes these three towers so unique, however, is the way that they are joined at the top. The view is just to die for!

Gillian Merry,5/5,"Fabulous hotel, staffed by great people. everything about this place is awesome, it deserves its iconic status.
Our room was exceptional; clean, well appointed, nicely furnished (it had two TVs!) and the view was incredible. Pay the extra for a high floor and marina bay view, you won’t be disappointed. Guests have exclusive access to the infinity pool on level 57. It does get busy, especially in the afternoon, but it is open from 6am to 11pm so there are quieter times to visit. NB the pool is not heated and can be chilly!  The pool bartenders are so nice and attentive. I would’ve relaxed here all day but the amazing views of Singapore beckon you.
The concierge team also deserve a mention. Welcoming, informative and really helpful about the hotel and Singapore in general. Ask them anything, they have the answer!

The staff from the ground will assist you up to your room and instruct you about the facilities they have in the hotel. I can say that this is more than 5 star hotel. My family enjoyed it. 💯 recommended. 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟⭐️"
Gajan,5/5,"Amazing Place to stay during your visit to Singapore. There’s so much to do at the location alone. They have easy indoor access to shopping , a casino and food courts.

The staff are always looking to make it an amazing experiences.

Finally the infinity pool provides for some awesome views and great pics.
If you haven’t stayed here before then you’re totally missing out.

Plan ahead and the pricing works out decently.","Edited 3 years ago on

We got a room on 21st floor with garden view, $630 USD/night. Infinity pool was not crowded at all in AM and we enjoyed calm atmosphere.

They offer all on-line check in with MBS smart Traveller app and we never had to wait in line to get a room key.  Everything went smooth.","2 years ago on

If walking you have to go underground to get out of the hotel. Remember in Singapore the car is king!

It is well worth it.  The rooftop pool area is amazing. However, the pool water isn’t heated.  Each guest needs to bring their room key to enter the pool area.  Depending on where your room is located, you may have to change elevators to get up to the pool area. There was not much seating in the main lobby area.

At sunset is very crowded and in my opinion it is even more impressive in the dark and there is not much going on. From the rooms I was unfortunately a little disappointed, you pay the high price only for the pool, the rest of the hotel is below the renowned 5 star competition.
The associated shopping center is also spectacular and one of the largest I have ever seen. Small travel hack in the in-house casino you get drinks, cigarettes and more for free.","Edited 2 years ago on

The cost is insane, but it's worth it to do it once and spoil yourself with that view! And the staff is amazing. Getting in and out of the casino can be a bit odd but it's due to the cost for locals vs free for tourists. The mall is high end, and the resteraunts are delicious. Be prepared to spend some money!","Edited 2 years ago on

The downside is everything there including food is expensive compared to the rest of Singapore.","Edited a year ago on

Had the opportunity to stay at the city view and the garden/ocean view. I love the sea so i would always prefer the latter.  Things to note during the Covid-19 phase. They do not mention this when ur booking the stay but they do inform u at the receptionist that in order to enter the infinity pool either to enjoy it or just walk around, you need to book a slot. Its an hr slot for each time ur book. And its limited. Due to they capped it at only 50-100pax at each slot. My advice is u book it when checking in. If u manage to get a slot, it will be fabulous.  The pool is basically empty due to everyone is spreaded apart. My kids had a good time since there were more space for them to play . ◡̈","5 years ago on

Erez Productions,5/5,"Such a great hotel!
If you’re visiting Singapore you must take at least one night to experience the hotel.
The hotel is well equipped, there is a gym and spa and casino and a whole new level of shopping experience. Oh and of course the tallest pool in the world (57th floor).
The staff is really nice and helpful.
The views from the pool deck (which is exclusive for hotel guests) is just incomparable. Spent hours there, day and night. The views are just addicting.
There is an MRT station right under the hotel (literally beneath it) so it’s so easy to get by.
The hotel is built from 3 buildings, which are huge, so take a little time to learn how to navigate through this huge complex.
The hotel is a bit pricey but it’s just so worth it.
Would definitely come back again.","3 years ago on

Scott,3/5,"Not worth the cost $3,800USD for 2 rooms for 2 nights. 1 of 2 rooms wasn’t ready for 1.5 hours after guaranteed checkin time and was full of cigarette smoke. They attempted to say they will “clean” it somehow as they said they were fully booked which we refused as our kids were staying there. After some arguing they agreed to find another room which they did. Not sure how as they previously said they were booked. Later that evening we got stuck unable to use elevators from pool when all our keys became disabled including our 1st room. By 8pm we finally had 2 rooms. This is after arriving at 1pm. Really disappointing for a hotel demanding such a high price.

While amazing views and experience from rooftop pool, I would never stay there again. Wasn’t worth it even with the frustration.","Edited 2 years ago on

kakajulia,2/5,"Definitely an overpriced place, the facility is outdated and the overall management is poorly designed. If you are there for casino and infinity pool this might be the place for you, but if you are there for leisure and holiday (like us), you might be ended up with huge disappointment. The hotel has no walk-in capacity for stay in guests at any bar/lounge, everything need to be booked in advance. We were planned to stay there for 3 nights but couldn’t find a place for a casual drink at any bar/lounge. The staff there was very friendly and managed to help us made a reservation at one of its bar, but there is a dress code which doesn’t allow any guests entry with slippers and shorts. (For god’s sake we just wanted to have a couple of drinks at the bar, who would wear a formal suit on the holiday with the temperature is around 33 degree Celsius)

I gave 2 star only to the staff there, they are very well trained and friendly. Overall a horrible experience. There are plenty of good 5 stars hotel in Singapore which have better facility/service. For the amount of money I have paid, the experience is not even close to expectations. I would never return there.","3 years ago on

Jane Bache,5/5,"I haven’t stayed here hence no score for rooms or room service however when ever I visit Singapore I always head on over to the hotel as I love the atmosphere
One can do the Skydeck Observation viewing which is fantastic I have done both day and night
I have also visited the top roof bar restaurant for lunch which was a great experience
One can have access to the underground shopping mall food court fantastic restaurants
Access to Gardens by the Bay

Even though I haven’t stayed I have found all those who work here to be so friendly helpful open the doors for you and give directions to find things happily it’s such a pleasure to visit here
Great  efficient taxi service too

I love to visit for the vibe it’s air conditioned a great way to escape the heat & humidity or if it’s a torrential rain pour head to Marina Bay Hotel to explore.

Highly recommend visiting","a year ago on

Yustinus Albert,5/5,"I'm not given a rate for room and service since I'm not staying in mbs. what i comment on is just the mall and locations. The mall is fabulous if you have money to buy. If not, you can walk around and eat only. So many famous items inside this mall and also so many tourists especially on weekends. You should come to this place if you come to Singapore. At least you can feel rich if you come inside.","2 years ago on

Noman Khan Aadam-Zaad,5/5,"Marina Bay Sands Singapore is an iconic landmark in the heart of Singapore that is known for its luxurious accommodations, world-class entertainment, and exceptional dining options. This magnificent hotel and entertainment complex is an ambitious project that has set a new standard for hospitality and entertainment in Southeast Asia.

One of the most impressive aspects of Marina Bay Sands is the ambition behind the project. The development of the complex was a massive undertaking that required extensive planning and execution. The result is a breathtaking structure that features three hotel towers, a massive shopping mall, a convention center, a museum, a casino, and a stunning rooftop infinity pool. The sheer scale of the project is a testament to the vision and dedication of the team behind it.

The staff at Marina Bay Sands are another impressive aspect of the complex. From the moment you arrive, you are greeted by friendly and professional staff members who go above and beyond to make your stay comfortable and enjoyable. The staff is well-trained and knowledgeable, and they are always willing to assist with any questions or concerns you may have. They take pride in their work, and it shows in their attention to detail and the high level of service they provide.

One of the things that impressed me most about the staff at Marina Bay Sands is the way they explain the various features and amenities of the complex. From the moment you check in, you are given a comprehensive overview of everything the complex has to offer, including information on the various dining options, entertainment venues, and shopping experiences. The staff takes the time to answer any questions you may have, and they do so in a friendly and informative manner.

Overall, Marina Bay Sands is an impressive complex that is well worth a visit. The ambition behind the project is evident in every aspect of the complex, from the stunning architecture to the exceptional staff. If you are looking for a luxurious and unforgettable experience in Singapore, Marina Bay Sands is the perfect destination.","2 years ago on

Danielle F,2/5,"What you’re really paying for when you stay here is to swim in the infinity pool, which is amazing!!! 5 stars for the pool and the pool staff.
BUT everything else is so average (plenty of much nicer accommodation on the island) and check in is painful. It took almost half an hour once I got to the front of the line and then I was told my room wasn’t ready and wouldn’t be for “maybe an hour” - this was at 3:30pm. You are paying a grand a night for that room, you would expect your room to be ready by the usual 3pm time. Luckily I asked if we could go up and use the pool until we had our room which they allowed and were nice about but they didn’t offer that up front. The staff are really nice but the hotel seems to have some strange and very strict processes which makes the stay feel really not holiday-yee. We loved the pool and staff but Otherwise the feel of the place wasn’t enjoyable. We hoped the experience for the price would be better!!

Although the room looks little bit classic or older, fantastic service I've received made me enough satisfied to enjoy perfectly my stay.

Maxim Mineev,4/5,"Liked - Obviously location, it is still the best. You are coming there for a great downtown view either from your room or from the rooftop pool. The pool is amazing but it is usually overcrowded and you have to spend time to find a spare sun bed.

Disliked · The rest a part from the above. The hotel is overpriced and we were not receiving that level of comfort that you could receive in any of 5* hotels near by. The room equipment was very weak and old, the free mini bar looked like a joke when you are paying 700$ per night. There were no bath in the bathroom.
We had a huge room but it looked empty, they might have added 2 armchairs in front of the window to enjoy the view, but it was not there.
It looked like very simple things were missing.
The hotel is undergoing renovation now and it looks like it will be even more expensive.","2 years ago on

Jodie,3/5,"Undeniably amazing views whichever side of either tower you stay in.
The staff were attentive to all needs.
Beautiful pool but not refreshing at all, like having a warm bath.
Great location and close to everything.
Hard beds on squeaky bases.
They put a double size comforter on a king size bed!!
Air con runs loudly and all night.
Staff failed to mention to us that there were transfers by boat from the hotel to the F1 track.","2 years ago on

Ruben F,4/5,"Marina Bay Sands in Singapore is a lively and bustling hotel that may not offer a standard relaxing experience. However, its renowned infinity pool lives up to all expectations. Perched atop the skyscrapers, the pool provides breathtaking views of the cityscape, creating a memorable and unique oasis amidst the busyness.

Caleb Sanchez,5/5,"A luxury mall with tons of stores and fancy restaurants. Don't be like us and miss out on the amazing food court. It's definitely a more affordable side of the mall that includes tons of smaller food stalls at better prices. Similar to a standard hawker centre, you can grab food from different spots and bring them back to the table and share. Just be warned, it's a very popular area so it's usually packed and sometimes difficult to find an open table, especially during lunch/dinner times. But there's lots of very tasty food and incredible teas and drinks.","3 years ago on

Loved the service and smile of everyone that serves us. Genuinely good service and positive attitude be it cleaners or the concierge.

Cobby Clan,5/5,"Iconic. This is the only way to describe this hotel. We arrived at 9.30am and yet they still checked us in, allowed us our room and were friendly and inviting. We are in room 3622 (36th floor,  room 22)

The cases were brought to the room within 15 minutes as promised, and the bed (for my 16 year old) arrived and was set up within 30 minutes.

You can arrange everything from the app and the large TV.

The room overlooked the gardens and bay as requested.

The room was large, had tea and coffee machines, a pre stocked and free mini fridge, and snack drawer.

The bathroom had a full set of amenities e.g. shower gel, shampoo, conditioner, tissues, dental kit etc. There were slippers and bath robes, which I noticed people also used around the pool.

The lifts are activated by swiping your room key card before selecting your floor. The room key card is also required to access the infinity pool on the roof, which also allocates you a towel.

The pool is amazing. It is warm and has the most amazing views across the river to Singapore, including the Merlion. The food is amazing. You can sit around the pool with anything from squid sushi rolls to burger and fries (both of which are delicious).

Whilst the pool is only open to hotel guests the observation deck is open to the public.

There is nothing to dislike about this experience. Well worth the stay. The last thing to mention is the staff, every one has been brilliant, friendly and charming.","2 years ago on

Dr Jade Kua,5/5,"Enjoyed our stay at MBS. Was there mainly for work but brought 3 kids along. We loved the views  and the spaciousness of the room. The shower & bathroom were a great size with lovely amenities from Roberto Cavalli but we did wish there was a bathtub!

Of note was the service quality. We had a dedicated team- Erica & Mark- assisting us with an early check-in. They even arranged for a little cake as they knew it was one of my son’s birthday and a bottle of wine… probably since I was solo-parenting with 3 kids!

The kids visited the pool several times even when it was grey & drizzly as the views were really lovely, and we went to many different restaurants throughout our stay which were all lovely, notably Rise, Spago & Lavo.","a year ago on

The room was cavernous and we got one without bathtub as it was a promotional offer. The rise restaurant was also huge and great menu on the list. The entry to the swimming pool was staggered and we could use 1 hr daily which was lovely and again the scene from atop was just beautiful.

Our last night I was hoping to take my daughter for a cocktail, but the bars were all rented out/booked and was told to use in-room dining. After calling and being on hold 30+ minutes was told it would be 75+ minutes for a cocktail to be delivered to the room. Huge disappointment!!! I do NOT recommend booking this hotel except for one night (for the pool pic) - other than that pick a hotel that has time and care for their customers. This was like a bad Disney experience.","2 years ago on

Matthieu MARY,5/5,"Such a stay!

The rooms are well designed, and the beds are comfortable. You can add an extra bed for a couple of hundred SG$ if you travel in family. They are comfortable too.
The room service delivers in less than 30 min at 9 PM. It's tasty.

There is no alcohol in the mini bar, but everything is free and refills every day.

The WiFi is very easy to access but not available when you are in your balcony and the windows are closed. Very reliable and fast enough to do everything  you want.

When you are on the balcony in a garden room, the road is a bit noisy. But when you close the windows, you can't hear quite nothing.

Between levels 10th to 20th in the garden side, you'll access twice per night to the gardens by the bay show directly from your room. Very pleasant.

There is a SMRT station in the mole next to the hotel.

There is a supermarket in this mole.

We went 3 or 4 times (morning, afternoon, evening) in the swimming pool and never had to wait: there were always plenty of free spaces.

Easy checkout. (Less than 2 min).

Bad points:
- WiFi not available on balcony
- road noise on the garden side in the lower levels
- 1st price wine in the room service which could be better.
- would love not finding the lights turned on after every room service.","2 years ago on

Jessy Eik,5/5,"Was upgraded to sky view room, is worth the stay. Room was spacious and the city view was breath taking.

The only problem is during the booking of pool time slot. Wouldn't it better to allow guest to secure the time slot upon hotel booking? Because when I get the access to book 1 day before my stay, all slots are booked and only left the earliest and the latest.","Edited 4 years ago on

The cost per floor is absurd so the higher the floor the more expensive.
The key stopped on the third day and had to wait 10 minutes to have a replacement key.

Bed: is stiff and and on the short side by your feet also the cover sounds like it has plastic.

Kate Driskell,4/5,"This isn't really a hotel, it's a captured resort experience. The rooms are enormous, fabulous and the housekeeping is absolutely top notch; we did not want for bottled water and juices over our 5 night stay.

The views are great if you get a high enough room and if you really want access to the pool then you must be booked into a high enough floor to be allowed. Access to the pool is strictly by one room key being presented per adult.

Where this place really falls down is that you absolutely must place a reservation if you want to eat. We were turned away at every single restaurant on the night we arrived and ended up having to order room service food. Inevitably wth a place this size, even despite the insulated trolley, it was cold by the time it got to us. For those of us who are more spontaneous, this is frustrating.","2 years ago on

Priyal Patel,4/5,"Nothing bad to say. It lives up to its expectations with sprawling expensive out of reach shops for ordinary citizens, only few shops that cater to middle class pockets. Food is overpriced, the buffet in the gambling Ruby room is better and much cheaper with a wide range of dish and yes, free flow of alcohol there. Other than that, it is an eye candy for those who want to snap photos and post it in Instagram.","2 years ago on

Hameed Aslam,5/5,"Marina Bay Sands® is a destination for those who appreciate luxury. An integrated resort notable for transforming Singapore's city skyline, it comprises three 55-storey towers of extravagant hotel rooms and luxury suites with personal butler services.

Visitors not staying at the hotel can buy tickets to the Sands SkyPark Observation Deck, which offers you unobstructed 360-degree views of the Singapore skyline.

Designed to be an integrated development, it also houses the Marina Bay Sands Casino, shopping mall, museum, and theatres that even non-hotel guests can enjoy. Some of these require tickets for admission, but the price of Marina Bay Sands' attractions is reasonable, given the deluxe experience they offer.

Smart casual wear is required in the casino (casual short pants, sleeveless shirts, slippers, and flip-flops are not allowed).

Take your enjoyment to greater heights at the SkyPark Observation Deck. 56 storeys up, in the heart of the Marina Bay Area, this scenic view of Singapore's world-class cityscape is uniquely breathtaking.

The resort is owned by Las Vegas Sands in agreement with the Singaporean authorities. Marina Bay Sands was originally set to open in 2009, but its construction faced delays caused by escalating costs of material and labour shortages from the outset exacerbated by the global financial crisis.

Marina Bay Sands - Hotel and SkyPark. Consistently ranked as one of the world's most spectacular pools, visitors flock to the SkyPark for a unique experience. It is the world's longest infinity pool (142 meters) and the largest outdoor pool at this height (650 meters).","Edited a year ago on

Bryan Wohlwend,4/5,"We decided to check off a bucket list item and stay at the Marina Bay Sands hotel specifically for the iconic pool.  And while I am glad we did, I likely wouldn’t stay there again honestly.  For the price, the rooms were really pretty average.  The view we had overlooking the Gardens by the Bay was great though as you could watch the Garden light show from your (tiny) balcony.  Bathroom was nice and large with good amenities.  Staff was overall friendly. The crowds definitely didn’t make it feel personal.  And frankly staying here felt almost like work rather than relaxing.  You had to remember to request check-in times and schedule pool times a day in advance (hard to do while traveling). Then each person has to have their own QR code—only available by SMS—for the pool, which was a problem because some in our party didn’t have cellular service to get the code. Luckily the pool staff accepted the room key and my confirmation email (likely helped we went early before it was crowded).  The pool was definitely impressive!!  It was also frustrating because they advertise over 90 restaurants but we didn’t know they all required reservations, even for lunch.  Most of these were in the mall (full of all the fancy stores and nothing in our price range!). We had a lot of trouble finding places to walk into to eat and that was just annoying.  It was also very crowded.  We did not visit the casino. Honestly the best way to describe the hotel is that you’ll feel like you are in a busy Vegas hotel like Caesar’s or the Bellagio.  It felt more like that than a 5 star hotel, especially considering it was likely the most expensive basic room I’ve ever stayed in.
Again it was fun to say we stayed there. We don’t regret it. But probably wouldn’t do it again. Just go into knowing to expect waits and crowds and that you are doing it to see one of the coolest pools ever.

I should note that one in my party completed a mid-stay survey from the hotel and got an almost instant follow up call. So they do seem to care about customer service.","3 years ago on

The rooftop bar and swimming pool are also definitely worth a look. However what it has in terms of grandeur we felt it lacks in terms of soul. The main concourse feels like an airport terminal except there is nowhere to sit and relax, have a coffee, and catch up with work or watch the world go by. The restaurants are OK but not great and the mall is very expensive and exclusive. We did like the lounge bar though and the gardens are great. If you really want to see Singapore I would suggest staying somewhere nearer to China town or Little India.","2 years ago on

Jackson Tan (Jackthehunter),5/5,"One of the best hotels in Singapore! You can experience the 'million' dollar views facing the CBD/city! The garden view is nice as well with the Gardens by the Bay! A little 'hectic' during check-in can be seen due to the current situation. Fortunately we were in the VIP though still need to queue. Going up and down the hotel room was tightly secured as well. Other than that, everything were fine. Made a booking at their Rise restaurant for dinner buffet. $75++ and food were acceptable though not the best I had. Last but not least, 'MUST GO' infinity swimming pool which is the best in Singapore! Prior booking is required during this period and can be fully booked very fast. Enjoy!","4 years ago on

Sachitanand Bhardwaj,5/5,"The famous luxurious hotel which has quite become the quintessential signature stamp of the city or country itself over the years. As much as it's luxurious, it's equally spacious and can accommodate a large numbers of guests too. The hotel looks over the garden by the bay on one side and the marina on the other which is the business district of Singapore.
Considered as one of the marvels of architecture it boasts of a boat design placed on the top of the hotel roof which serves as the purpose of an infinity pool. Not only from inside but the beauty of the hotel can also be viewed from outside and during evening when the entire are is lit up. During holidays, a laser show is also held which looks fascinating and this can be accessed via a boat drive situated nearby Clark quey overlooking the merlion statue.","2 years ago on

Diana Yee,5/5,"Always loved the in room dining here. Their Char Keay teoh is one of my favourites here. Each time I order  it, it is good! The kids loved it too every though it is a little spicy, they still eat it. Love the view.  This time is was so windy it was raining so didn't enjoy it this time. They probably need to make their shelters abit wider so people can still sit up the top near the pool and enjoy the scenery . It is usually windy up so high. My in laws got an anniversary cake. We received 1 too. Staff are very helpful and nice. One of the staff that helped us downstairs and even got our kids little toys which was really nice.  They helped us check in a bit earlier because the kids were sitting in the wind and needed to nap. Would still go here again but weather is always a worry up so high.","2 years ago on

The only issue I have is with the allowing of Indian/Pakistani & Bengali men to wear open toe sandals and show an awful lot of poor hygiene, I strongly suggest that the MBS strictly enforces the dress code as its wholly unacceptable and not what you expect from what on its face, service and facilities should be deemed entirely unacceptable, shirts, trousers & shoes should be the bare minimum as is required in Las Vegas's most high end establishments.","a year ago on

A few cons:
1. Men’s gym’s sauna area is located in the same room as toilets, no doors. Resulting in nasty sewage smell when you bath.
2. Morning breakfast area is huge(Rise restaurant), if you get seated on the outskirts, the food goes cold before you sit down and start eating. That’s how much there is to walk.
3. Some of room utensils are low quality - tooth brush and slippers specifically. The brush easily falls apart and threads get stuck in your teeth. Slippers reek of plastic.
Everything else is good, worth it.","2 years ago on

The interior design is beautiful and the architecture speaks for itself as one of the most unique buildings in the world, made exceptional but the unique infinity pool experience only available to guests staying.

The gym is also a unique experience alongside the spa and almost unbelievably polite staff.
The rooms are remarkable and have a very unique feature where the curtains automatically open as you enter slowly unveiling a draw jopping view of the banking district and harbour.

The connected shopping mall and subway lines add convenience and put you in proximity to one of the highlight tourist destinations of Singapore.","Edited 4 years ago on

2) we checked in 3.40pm, we book high floor room but it was not ready. Only level 15 was available. If we needed high floor we will need to wait another few hours. As explained by lobby.

3) parking issue. I first called lobby and the lady wasn't sure and send me to conceige to check. Conceige counter says they can't give me a ticket because the current ticket on hand expires. Ask me to go lobby counter, and when I went to lobby counter they say they cant issue the ticket because it expires and I can only collect when I check out. I had to explain same scenario 3 times to different people.... (they don't know their SOP??)

It's cramped on the borderline of health and safety and simply not hygenic. You cannot rely on people taking shower after long flight.
Never again! If you must because of the view, don't do more than 1night. It's not a pleasant stay, 20mins waiting time for breakfast at the restaurant to sit, 60mins room service. No Gym, you have to go to shopping mall oposite and one pool only. I would avoid at all cost.","2 years ago on

I don’t know who mandated it, but at Raffles I didn’t see staff forced to wear masks - only at Marina Bay Sands. When I see staff wearing masks it makes me feel as if there is a caste system in the country - the poor are forced to “protect” the rich from their “germs”. It’s really gross to weild this kind of power & enforcement upon the people who are unable to defend themselves because they need their jobs. It also makes me think maybe Marina Bay Sands actually has a huge health & sanitation problem - otherwise why such harsh treatment of workers?  If it’s not just MBS, maybe Singapore is the problem. No hotel worker should be forced to wear a mask.  In the future, I’ll avoid travelling to countries where the poor are forced to mask - it’s a human right to breathe fresh air.","a year ago on

Clay McClure,4/5,"Typical casino/convention hotel. It's crowded, there was a long line to check-in, the room was perfectly adequate and had a nice view of the super tree grove, but did not wow. Unlike every other hotel we stayed in on our honeymoon tour of southeast Asia there was no special gift or card awaiting us in our room. Housekeeping did send up a generic box of chocolates later, which was too little too late to impress. It's not a great hotel for a romantic getaway.

We opted to stay here only because of the rooftop infinity pool, which is only accessible to hotel guests. The pool is impressive, but also crowded, with a menagerie of Asian and European tourists taking glamour shots at the edge.

If we did the trip again, I would stay at MBS first, instead of last. MBS is adequate but just can't compare to the personalized service we enjoyed in Thailand and Cambodia.","2 years ago on

Noiselevel2,2/5,"My wife and I stayed here for my 35th Birthday. Being basically THE iconic landmark of Singapore, we had high expectations for the stay and ultimately were let down. Although the façade and much of the shopping/main MBS area exudes a 5-star resort feel, the actual rooms are extremely basic. Nothing about our stay was ""5-star"", for what the final bill was, I would expect a lot more in terms of room amenities, bed quality, overall service, resort perks, etc. Honestly at the end of the day, I just felt like another number in the que. The 57th floor pool is nice for the view only, after that wears off there really is no substance at all. The menu you can order from is tiny (even though there are 3 restaurants up there, you can't order from them....what), the water is seriously frigid, and the drink menu is lacking. There is really no atmosphere at all up there either, from music to theme, to....anything. You just look at the view and pay  for overpriced drinks and food until you've had enough. The good thing is, there is plenty of options for F&B in the area, so no matter what you are looking for you are bound to find it.

Overall I would not recommend staying here, for what they charge and what you get, it really not worth it. There are several extremely nice hotels/stays in Singapore very much more worth you stay than here.","Edited 2 years ago on

Bruce Waldner,4/5,"My wife and I stayed at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel for three nights in May of 2022. Would I recommend this resort to a friend? Yes. Would I stay their again knowing what I know now about the resort? Yes.

We had a Deluxe King Sky View. It had great views of the city and skyline. The only reason we stayed at the hot was for access to the roof top infinity pool. It it wasn’t for the pool I would not stay at the hotel. It doesn’t feel like you are staying in a hotel. It feels like you are staying in a mall. The hotel is big and impersonal.

The pool is great. Amazing views of the city. However, my wife and I were wanting to have a drink in the pool and watch the sun set. Sounds great doesn’t it. But the pool area does not have an adult only section or pool. This means that there are always screaming splashing kids around you. Don’t get me wrong, I raised two screaming splashing kids. However when you’re paying $1000/night for a room, an adult only section in the pool isn’t too much to ask for.

Additionally, my wife loves to have a bath before bed and the deluxe rooms only have showers.

WI-FI in the rooms was strong. Free waters and sodas in the room were a nice touch. Also the free ice cream at the pool.

We signed up for the Sands reward club and got free breakfast at Spagos and a free happy hour one night.

Shriya Beri,5/5,"We went to the mall in Marina Bay Sands called the Shoppe. It reflected luxury and money. It's a mall when most brands are high end and only very few fall in the affordable zone. From Michelen Star restaurants to cafes it's a place buzzing with people. There is a small waterbody within the mall which can be travered on a boat they call Sampan. This ride would be just about 250 mts and exorbitantly priced. They charge extra to take you to the eye of the waterfall which doesn't work half the time. So best is just walk those 250 mts gazing at those beautiful stores. Very well connected to the metro. Also, there are drone shows that happen here in the evenings which are perhaps worth a watch. There is also a museum within the complex.","a year ago on

Rakhi Priyadarshini,5/5,"Fantastic experience! Highly recommended!

This was our second stay in MBS, however, I couldn't post a review previously as we had to cut our stay short due to my baby falling sick.

This time, we had a staycation for 4D3N during CNY2022 and it's lovely experience.
The moment you enter hotel premises, you're made to feel why MBS is worth the hype and more!
Check-in process was smooth despite the large crowd & the staff members ensured everyone is well attended to. We proceeded to our room and the luggage arrived soon after.
Room size was good enough. Very clean and pleasant with a beautiful view from the balcony. All the amenities are high quality and well maintained. Loved the bathroom :)
Services are pretty quick and the concierge/room service respond to calls in almost no time. Very impressive, considering the hotel was almost full capacity.
I was overjoyed to see plenty of options in breakfast for my dietary requirements (vegetarian, allergic to eggs) and they're delicious! The breakfast place is very well maintained with nice & warm staffs. They're very helpful in adjusting to my baby's mood who went bit noisy & started dropping cutlery at one point. Thanks for that and apologies for the inconvenience.
In-room dining service is bit expensive but quality is good with adequate portions. They serve within the stipulated time. No delays.
We also explored the infinity pool and observation deck, and both are totally worth the praise. We've been to observation deck couple of times earlier as well, however, infinity pool was just second time as it's limited only for hotel guests.
We can't wait enough to book another staycation with MBS as it never ceases to amaze us with its grandeur and services which is world class.

This was our second stay in MBS, however, I couldn't post a review previously as we had to cut our stay short due to my baby falling sick.

This time, we had a staycation for 4D3N during CNY2022 and it's lovely experience.
The moment you enter hotel premises, you're made to feel why MBS is worth the hype and more!
Check-in process was smooth despite the large crowd & the staff members ensured everyone is well attended to. We proceeded to our room and the luggage arrived soon after.
Room size was good enough. Very clean and pleasant with a beautiful view from the balcony. All the amenities are high quality and well maintained. Loved the bathroom :)
Services are pretty quick and the concierge/room service respond to calls in almost no time. Very impressive, considering the hotel was almost full capacity.
I was overjoyed to see plenty of options in breakfast for my dietary requirements (vegetarian, allergic to eggs) and they're delicious! The breakfast place is very well maintained with nice & warm staffs. They're very helpful in adjusting to my baby's mood who went bit noisy & started dropping cutlery at one point. Thanks for that and apologies for the inconvenience.
In-room dining service is bit expensive but quality is good with adequate portions. They serve within the stipulated time. No delays.
We also explored the infinity pool and observation deck, and both are totally worth the praise. We've been to observation deck couple of times earlier as well, however, infinity pool was just second time as it's limited only for hotel guests.
We can't wait enough to book another staycation with MBS as it never ceases to amaze us with its grandeur and services which is world class.
Kudos to the team! You're doing a wonderful job!!"

Karin Chan,5/5,"The check-in was hassle free with minimal guests standing in line to queue as hotel has an online queue booking system prior to reaching the hotel. It was so unlike before covid times where I remembered I waited so so so long before I could check-in & the crowd was horrible.

Booking for pool session was easy too. Just follow the instructions in the email sent prior to checking in. We enjoyed full 1.25 hour of swim & life guards on duty will prompt you 10 min before session ends. So make sure you are on time. No crying kids cos all had to clear for next session guests to enter.

Breakfast at Level 57 was lovely too. Wait for a table through the staff, orders came really fast & food was nicely presented. Yummy too.

Needless to mention, check out was fast too. Just drop the key cards and that’s all. Wonderful staycation experience. 👍🏻","3 years ago on

Marina Bay Sands is one of them. The towering structure, awesome shopping, connecting to the Gardens by the Bay...phew...just too good.

The count of  number of photos I have clicked Marina Bay Sands keeps increasing.

I feel Marina Bay Sands shows up unique ways in different angles.

I am yet to stay there or use the casino. The awe is high at just the structure and shopping alone so far.

If you are visitor or resident, a visit to Marina Bay Sands, walking around and inside the mall is a must do activity.","Edited a year ago on

Vienna,3/5,"I came here ten years ago when it was first finished. At that time, I just thought the room was very big and the view was good.  Now Marina bay  sands is basically the standard for tourists, and a large number of people go to the top-floor swimming pool to take pictures.  But when it comes to style and aesthetics, it's really far from it.  It can only be said that it is an artificial super scenic spot.  There are a large number of hotels that are better than this.","3 years ago on

Bing Xuan Ho,4/5,"It's not your typical western restaurants that just serve steaks and burgers.

They serve modernised versions of those dishes with the ingredients rethought. A great place if you are looking for surprises.

Great selection of wines available as well, I suggest go for wine pairing so you would have the right wine set for each of the dishes.

To be they generally tastes great but not outstanding.

The waiters are nice as well, explaining the wines and the dishes in detail. Only thing is that it's noisier that I would like. But atmosphere is good. There's an Asian lady waiter as well, which definitely do help for those who feel stressed under Western accent environments.","4 years ago on
