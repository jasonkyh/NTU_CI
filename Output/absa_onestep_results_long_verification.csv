Everything has been thought out to the last detail. Very comfortable and at the highest level. One thing that spoiled the whole experience of staying at this lovely hotel was the service of some of the staff. Unfortunately I made a mistake when booking and forgot to include breakfasts in our stay. During the check-in I asked the manager to add breakfasts and pay for them, to which I received the answer that it is not a problem, you pay a deposit, which allows you to attend breakfast and the money will be withdrawn from this account. I specifically asked about the best place to choose for breakfast and chose the restaurant by the pool on the 57th floor. What was our surprise when, instead of the breakfast sets offered, we were given the a la carte menu and informed that we could not get their breakfast sets that we were so eager to try. After that, when we informed the hotel manager about the situation - they didn't help us in any way, except apologizing. After that we went to their buffet where there were also a lot of strange things from the staff like bringing the bill during the meal, a few clarifications on what room we were in and communication problems during the ordering of hot drinks.

Cleanliness was basic and the room itself was very nice. Bathroom amenities were disposable Jo Malone products, the dryer was a Dyson product, and in addition, there was a bath bomb and a neck pillow that can be used while taking a half-body bath. The shower gown and slippers were so pretty that I loved them :) Not to mention the view. It was so cool without it! Personally, I was very satisfied with choosing the garden view because the city view was visible from the pool and didn't feel special. Breakfast and the food we ordered at the pool were so delicious!

A balcony, too. It's a real treat to be able to slide the windows open and sit on the balcony in the evening, admiring the garden and ships from the 36th floor. The staff are very friendly and helpful. During check-in, the lovely receptionists explained the rules ahead of time, even before I asked. I also received water because it was obvious I needed it. A nice gesture, thank you. I appreciated the organizational solutions – information about available rooms is sent via email, and thanks to Wi-Fi, you don't have to worry about mobile data. The queue management at the reception desk, very fast check-out, and the possibility of early check-in to wait for a room at the pool area. Those with large suitcases can leave them at the reception until their room is ready. Access to the pool, bars, and rooftop restaurant makes all the difference.

Right from the start, she made me feel at ease with her warm, professional approach and calming setup. Her technique struck the perfect balance between relaxing and genuinely therapeutic—she somehow knew exactly where the tension was and worked through it without me having to say much at all!

The pressure was spot on, and she checked in just enough to make sure I was comfortable. By the end of the session, I felt completely relaxed and could feel a big difference, especially in my back and shoulders. U can tell Lisa really knows her craft and puts genuine care into her work.
